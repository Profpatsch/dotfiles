We were the ones who weren't afraid
We were the broken hearted
We were the scars that wouldn't fade away

How did we let go?
How did we forget?
That we don't have to hide.
We won't believe the lies again
We won't be paralyzed

We can be who we are
Now we are alive
We can fight
They cannot contain us
It's who we are
We are undying
We are forever

Won't hide our faces from the light
Eliminate this space between us
It's who we are
We are forever
It's who we are!

We were the tears that passion cried
We were the sacrifice
We were the flame that wouldn't die inside

How did we go wrong?
We will not forget
We won't be left behind
We won't give up the fight again
We won't be denied

We can be who we are
Now we are alive
We can fight
They cannot contain us
It's who we are
We are undying
We are forever

Won't hide our faces from the light
Eliminate this space between us
It's who we are
We are forever
It's who we are!

WE WILL NEVER DIE!
WE WILL NEVER DIE!
WE WILL NOT DENY!
NOW WE ARE ALIVE!

We can be who we are
Now we are alive
We can fight
They cannot contain us
It's who we are
We are undying
We are forever

Won't hide our faces from the light
Eliminate this space between us
It's who we are
We are forever
It's who we are!
