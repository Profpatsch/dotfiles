Wake every heart and every tongue
To sing the new eternal song
And crown Him King of Glory now
Confess Him, Lord of all

You are the highest
You are the greatest
You are the Lord of all
Angels will worship
Nations will bow down
To the Lord of all

A day will come when all will sing
And glorify our matchless King
Your name unrivalled stands alone
You are the Lord of all

Let every heart
Let every tongue
Sing of Your name
Sing of Your name
Let every heart
Let every tongue
Sing, sing, sing

Lifting You higher, higher and higher
