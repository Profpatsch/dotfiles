I search for You God of strength
I bow to You In my brokenness
And no other king could have so humbly come
To save my soul and heal my heart

PreChorus:
I have nothing more
Than all You offer me
There is nothing else
That's of worth to me

Chorus:
And i love You Lord You rescued me
You are all that i want You're all i need

Bridge 1:
I pray to You God of peace
I rest in You My cares released

Bridge 2:

In Your freedom I will live, In Your freedom i will live
I offer devotion, I offer devotion
