I tell you the truth when I say that the kingdom is on the way, on the way
I tell you the truth when I say that the kingdom is here today, here today

I think I found it,
An inspiration
I can see a glorious nation

It's over there just above Zion
And it looks like Jerusalem

It's on the way, the date is set
It's here today, but not here yet
Can almost hear, can almost see
It's a banner caught upon the breeze

Upon it is a Lion...

I tell you the truth when I say that the kingdom is on the way, on the way
I tell you the truth when I say that the kingdom is here today, here today
Christ reigns now and don't forget that the kingdom is not yet!

It's getting closer
To fulfillment
But the kingdom began with the advent
He is reigning through his people
The first will be nothing compared to the sequel

No more war, no more crime, no more unemployment line!
And there is Christ upon His seat
Where mercy, truth and justice meet

And He will never falter...

I tell you the truth when I say that the kingdom is on the way, on the way
I tell you the truth when I say that the kingdom is here today, here today
Christ reigns now and don't forget that the kingdom is not yet!

And with one voice, we all will sing
(Yeah yeah yeah)
To the Prince of peace and King of kings
(Yeah yeah yeah)
His reign is everlasting
(Yeah yeah yeah)

I tell you the truth when I say that the kingdom is on the way, on the way
I tell you the truth when I say that the kingdom is here today, here today

I tell you the truth when I say that the kingdom is on the way, on the way
I tell you the truth when I say that the kingdom is here today, here today

Here today.
