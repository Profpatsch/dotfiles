Early light that burns my eyes,
A minute more the sun will rise
And paint the bright blue sky with yellow gold
I’ll be dead asleep by then,
Shut up in this box again
Until it’s gone
Outside I can hear it
Birds are singing, bees are buzzing, sun shines overhead
I’d be there to see it but I can’t get out of bed
Since the day you left the weather always feels this way
One more blue sunny day

Looking for an easy mark
I hit the Denny’s after dark
And take a lonely waitress home to drink,
She’s sincere, but halfway through
I find I’m wishing she was you
My blood goes cold
I guess this date is over
Several hours later I’m the only one awake
All these streets are empty, it’s just me and my mistake
One by one the stars go out as black sky turns to gray
One more blue sunny day

Sometimes I see how long I can wait
Tempting disaster by my garden gate
My trembling hand on the cellar door
Trying not to think of what it is I’m waiting for

All at once I’ve had enough
As if I’m made of sterner stuff
I take a breath and open up the door
Dawn breaks hard and falls on me
For just one moment I can see
The pale blue sky
I close my eyes because
The world’s so bright and beautiful I have to look away
Braced against the beauty of another perfect day
As I go to pieces and the breeze blows me away
One more blue sunny day
