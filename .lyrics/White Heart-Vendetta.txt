Count the locks upon your door
Guess Beaver doesn't live here anymore
A gun for me, a gun for you
Now they're killing people for their tennis shoes

Young and old share the fear
A violent streak is running everywhere
Oooh, it's hard to say how it got this way

Feel the anger burning
Holy anger rising up in you
What should we do?

Vendetta against the raging world
Vendetta against the lies we've heard
Vendetta led by love not hate
It's the only way the pattern breaks, Oh!

Quietly we lose the hope
While the media pushes the envelope
Hear the warning cries, the siren's blare
I wonder do we love enough to care?

Care enough to stand
Heal this broken land
And love the lost
At any cost

Vendetta against the raging world
Vendetta against the lies we've heard
Vendetta led by love not hate
It's the only way the pattern breaks, Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!!

Vendetta, vendetta

Ooooooh-oooh!!
