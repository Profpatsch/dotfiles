I thought I had it all under control 
I thought my fate was still in my hands 
All of my plans were firmly set 
By the words that I say 
I forgot how quickly things can change 
Now my vision can not be the same 

My life is not what I thought 
I'm not where I planned to be 
Though something's gone 
There's nothing wrong with my changing world 
Though something's gone 
There's nothing wrong with my changing world 

I need to let go of my destiny 
I need to trust in things unseen 
I believe in having faith 
Though I yield my control 
I forgot how quickly things can change 
Now my vision can not be the same 

My life is not what I thought 
I'm not where I planned to be 
Though something's gone 
There's nothing wrong with my changing world 
Though something's gone 
There's nothing wrong with my changing world 
In the world, in my changing world

I'm embracing all of my fears 
I am watching them turn to delight 
The very fears which were gripping my mind 
Are now the hands shaping and sculpting my dreams

My life is not what I thought 
I'm not where I planned to be 
Though something's gone 
There's nothing wrong with my changing world 
Though something's gone 
There's nothing wrong with my changing world

In the world, in my changing world
In the world, in my changing world
