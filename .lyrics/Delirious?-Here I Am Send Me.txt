<b>The Mission Bell version:</b>
Show me a vision like Isaiah saw,
Where the angel touched his lips
And he sinned no more
Let me hear Your voice saying
"Whom shall I send?"
I'll say send me Lord,
I'll follow You to the end

Show me a vision like Ezekiel saw,
An army of light
From a valley of bones
Breathe life into these lungs of mine,
So I can scream and shout
Of Your love divine

Search light, burns bright,
Floods my eyes,
Invade me serenade me,
I'm giving back my life

Here I am send me,
Here I am send me,
There's nothing in my hands,
But here I am send me

I'm in Jacob's dream seeing
Heaven's gate
Let me climb all night
On my ladder of faith,
Wrestle with the angel
Till my body is weak,
Dislocate my bones
For it's You that I seek

Show me the light Paul Apostle saw,
When he fell to the dust
And he could see no more,
Open my eyes, open my eyes
Open my eyes, open my eyes

Search light, burns bright,
Floods my eyes,
Invade me serenade me,
I'm giving back my life

Here I am send me,
Here I am send me,
There's nothing in my hands,
But here I am send me

Oh

Search me
Search me
Search me

I'm frightened what You'll find,
When You open up my heart,
I'm walking in the light,
Cos it's light that changes the atmosphere,
So touch these lips that criticise,
And put a song in my mouth
That opens our eyes

Open our eyes

So here I am send me,
Here I am send me,
There's nothing in my hands,
But here I am send me

Here I am send me,
Here I am send me,
There's nothing in my hands, (there's nothing, I'm nothing, I'm nothing)
But here I am send me
