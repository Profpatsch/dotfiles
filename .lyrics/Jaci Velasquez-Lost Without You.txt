I know I can be a little stubborn
sometimes

You might say, 
A little righteous andtoo proud

I was lookin' for a way to compromise
Thinkin' maybe I could work things out

I thought I had all the answers
Never givin' in

But You loved me all along
And I admit I was wrong

(CHORUS)

All I know is I'm lost without You
I'm not gunna lie

I could never be strong without You 
I need you be my side

If I ever thought we'd never be together
'Cause of all my foolish pride

Don't know what I'd do
I'm lost without You

I keep tryin' to find my way
But all I know is

I'm lost without You
I keep tryin' to face the day 
I'm lost without You

You're the only one
who gets rid of these blues

When I fall You'll catch me every time

The way You give me clarity
when I'm comfused

Just to hear Your voice
can ease my mind

Oh my world's so cold at night
When I wander far away

Only You can make it right
No I'm not too proud to say

(CHORUS)

I keep tryin' to find my way
But all I know is
I'm lost without You

I keep tryin' to face the day 
I'm lost without You

I know that You can hear me now
Make the pain just go away

Stop all the all the tears from 
running down my face

Lord
(CHORUS)

I keep tryin' to find my way 
But all I know is 
I'm lost without You 

I keep tryin' to face the day 
I'm lost without You
