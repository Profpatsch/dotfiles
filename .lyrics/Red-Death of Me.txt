I should have seen all these signs around me
But I was comfortable inside these wounds
So go ahead and take another piece of me now
While we all bow down to you

You tear me down and then you pick me up
You take it all but still it's not enough
You try to tell me you can heal me
But I'm still bleeding and you'll be the death of me

How can you end my affliction
If you’re the sickness and not the cure?
Too long I’ve faked this addiction
Another sacrifice to make us pure

You tear me down and then you pick me up
You take it all until it's not enough
You try to tell me you can heal me
But I'm still bleeding and you'll be the death of me

You tear me down and then you pick me up
You take it all until it's not enough
You try to tell me you can heal me
But I'm still bleeding and you'll be the death of me

I won't forget
I cannot forget this
I won't forget
I'll never forget this
I won't forget
I cannot forget this
I won't forget
I'll never forget this

I won't forget
I cannot forget this
I won't forget
I'll never forget this
I won't forget
I cannot forget this
I won't forget
I'll never forget this

You know that I cannot prove this solution
You aren't the one that I thought you were
And so I learned to embrace this illusion
The line that separates it starts to blur

You tear me down and then you pick me up
You take it all but still its not enough
You try to tell me you can heal me
But I'm still bleeding and you'll be the death of me

And you will be the death of me

I won't forget
I cannot forget this

And you'll be the death of me!
