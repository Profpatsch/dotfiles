You're cold that way
And that's why you say
The things that you say
You can't attract
The things that you lack
You're trying in vain

It seems it's always the crazy times
You find you'll wake up and realize
It takes more than your saline eyes
To make things right

You spiral down
You've broken your crown
You don't feel like a queen
You've seen the proof
But you're still crying wolf
You'll never believe

It seems it's always the crazy times
You find you'll wake up and realize
It takes more than your saline eyes
To make things right

You try to climb a broken ladder
Grip the missing rungs
And fall down, down, down, down
Seems some time ago you said
This wouldn't last
And now you sit here crying, yeah

Beside your bed
You feel left for dead
You kneel in the dark

It takes more than your saline eyes
To make things right

It seems it's always the crazy times
You find you'll wake up and realize
It takes more than your saline eyes
To make things right
