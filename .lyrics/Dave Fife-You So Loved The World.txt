What kind of love is this?
What kind of love forgives?
What kind of love would love me just for me?
Love that brings me peace
Frees me from my deeds
What kind of love would fi ll my eyes to see

God, You so loved the world
That You sent Your only Son
God, You so loved the world
That You gave Your precious One for me

There upon the cross
Your heart was for the lost
What kind of love could have such mystery
Death it can withstand
Joy that has no end
What kind of love would claim such victory
