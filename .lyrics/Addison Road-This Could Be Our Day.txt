What we do here is just the beginning
New life is starting at every ending
We are a part of the story unfolding
This is the weight of the world we are holding
This could be our day
This could be our day

Clearly it's time to make a change
Or I could keep sitting and waste all day
I know that it's time for to move
I've been given this minute to use
And given this moment to prove that

Chorus

I was holding back
Now I've come undone
I want to touch the world
Heal the broken ones
Ending the cycle has just begun
We've been given this minute to use
And given this life to prove

Chorus

To give ourselves away
For something beautiful
A million miles away
To the one who's hungry, and thirsty

And needs some hope
To the people that are weary and
Broken and left alone
I'm giving myself away
I'm giving myself away

Chorus
