Thank God, the world's been saved
Marx is in his grave
The hammer and sickle lie broken on the ground
If we're through with history
Then why this misery?
All the world was thrilled to the sound
When the wall came crashin' down

(So tell me what I can't explain)
This howling deep within my veins
(Is it the pulling of some secret tide?)

It's the raging...
The raging of the moon
Oh, we must awaken
From the raging of the moon

See the path we take
See the bed we make
Oh let the Spirit open up our eyes
(We get comfortable with our lies)
The magic's at an end
The line's been crossed again
The truth keeps getting further from our lives
It's all been disguised

(The moon is full and red as wine)
A symbol of our fallen times
(When will the stars come crashing down from our eyes)

It's the raging...
The raging of the moon
Oh, we must awaken
From the raging of the moon

Are we shaken?
For the signs are coming true
Oh, we must awaken
From the raging of the moon!

(It's the raging...
The raging of the moon
Oh we must awaken
From the raging of the moon)

OHHH, we must awaken!!
From the RAAAAA!!!!!!!
