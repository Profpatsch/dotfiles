I'm an alien
Cuz I'm not of this world
I have a name 
but I've been changed, and now I can't stay the same
and I'm a loser if that means I've been lost before
but now I found it, I'm surrounded 
Cuz you can hear the way it sounded


Like angels singing with a million voices

[Chorus:]
The end is where we begin
It's crawling back when
We run away, run away
cuz the end is where we begin
Where broken hearts mend
and start to beat again
The end is where we begin

[Verse 2:]
I'm a monster if that means I'm misunderstood
Cuz its alive and I can't hide it
The energy is rising
and I'm a trader if that means I've turned on myself
I can't deny it, it's like a riot
and I can't keep it quiet

[Pre-Chorus]
Like angels singing with a million voices

[Chorus:]
The end is where we begin
It's crawling back when
We run away, run away
Cuz the end is where we begin
Where broken hearts mend
and start to beat again
The end is where we begin

[Bridge:]
Hear me running
Hear me running, running
Hear me running, hear me running, ra-running
Hear me running, hear me

[Chorus:]
The end is where we begin
It's crawling back when
We run away, run away
Cuz the end is where we begin
Where broken hearts mend
and start to beat again

The end is where we begin
It's crawling back when
We run away, run away
Cuz the end is where we begin
Where broken hearts mend
and start to beat again
The end is where we begin
