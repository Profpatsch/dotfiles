On earth as in heaven
We will be strong together
On earth as in heaven
We will be untethered
No martyr can ever
Divide our beating hearts

On earth as in heaven
Your beauty, forever
The sunrise inside me
Calls out to you in mourning

How I hold on
Free from ever
Feeling your life
Touch me from heaven

On earth as in heaven
My soul needs you
But can your heart answer
Afraid you'd be part to
Consent to seal our kingdom

How I hold on
Free from ever
Seeing your light
Touched you, so loved you

On earth as in heaven
Your beauty is forever
No martyr can ever
Divide our beating hearts
