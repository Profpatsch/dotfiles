You found me, You found me
Once I was lost but now I'm found
You loved me, You loved me
You broke the chains that held me down

You healed me, You healed me
Once I was blind but now I see
You freed me, You freed me
With what You did at Calvary
Thank You for the cross

You are stronger than sin, You're the cure for my disease
You are more than enough, more than enough for me
Your grace has made a way for me to say what I believe
I am found, I am loved, I am healed
I am free, I am free

You found me, You found me
Once I was lost but now I'm found
You loved me, You loved me
You broke the chains that held me down

You healed me, You healed me
Once I was blind but now I see
You freed me, You freed me
With what You did at Calvary
Thank You for the cross

You are stronger than sin, You're the cure for my disease
You are more than enough, more than enough for me
Your grace has made a way for me to say what I believe
I am found, I am loved, I am healed

You are stronger than sin, You're the cure for my disease
You are more than enough, more than enough for me
Your grace has made a way for me to say what I believe
I am found, I am loved, I am healed
I am free, I am free, I am free, I am free

Come on, well I was lost locked down in the prison of my mind
I was blind to the ways that had me caught up in a bind
I was bound by the shackles that were tacklin' my hope
I was livin' like a fool who'd been given much rope

Steady me, steady me 'cause I'm about to freak
Steady me, steady me, it's gettin' kinda deep
But then You crept in, stepped in with a ray of light
One glimpse from the fence and I fell to Your side

Steady me, steady me 'cause I'm about to freak
Steady me, steady me, it's gettin' kinda deep
'Cause one shot of Your grace and my space been changed
To a clear atmosphere, it's a brand new day

'Cause I'm free baby, I'm free
They can't take it away from me
'Cause I'm free baby, I'm free
They can't take it away from me

No more chains holding me, I have been delivered
No more chains holding me, I am free indeed
No more chains holding me, I have been delivered
No more chains holding me, I am free indeed

No more chains holding me, I have been delivered
No more chains holding me, I am free indeed
No more chains holding me, I have been delivered
No more chains holding me, I am free indeed

'Cause I'm free baby, I'm free
They can't take it away from me
'Cause I'm free baby
They can't take it away from me
