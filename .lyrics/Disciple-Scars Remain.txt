What is 
All this? 
The question I am asking
It's not 
What is
I feel like I was promised

This hurts 
This leaves 
A lasting laceration
I can't 
Believe 
That this is what my faith was for

The scars remain
Reminds of pain
The scars remain

When I see you I see scars that are matching
When I see you I see scars that are matching
I know what I'm feeling you are feeling scars remaining through
When I see you I see scars

My feet will sink in this quicksand around me
Unless something or someone comes to save me

This hurts 
This leaves 
A lasting laceration
I can't 
Believe 
That this is what my faith was for

The scars remain
Reminds of pain
The scars remain

When I see you I see scars that are matching
When I see you I see scars that are matching
I know what I'm feeling you are feeling scars remaining through
When I see you I see scars that are matching

When I see you I see scars that are matching
When I see you I see scars that are matching
I know what I'm feeling you are feeling scars remaining through
When I see you I see scars that are matching
