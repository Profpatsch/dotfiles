Is my imagination running away or is all this really happening to me?
Am I a prince in a far-away land filled with fantasy?

Where is reailty and what are the actions that will define who I am?
I am holding on to the visions I've seen of what I could be
It's what I should be

More than it seems these dreams inside blur reality's line
If I could believe the dreams aside, I am capable more than it seems

More than it seems

Passing through darkness into my own world
Will I be more than when I left, be more than when I left?
Never letting go of the lessons I've learned, this will make a change
A change within me

More than it seems these dreams inside blur reality's line
If I could believe the dreams aside, I am capable more than it seems

This time I won't run away
I found the strength to fight life's long days
This time I won't run away

More than it seems these dreams inside blur reality's line
If I could believe the dreams aside, I am capable more than it seems

More than it seems these dreams inside blur reality's line
If I could believe the dreams aside, I am capable more than it seems

'Til there's nothing left of me
Show me the way to these dreams
