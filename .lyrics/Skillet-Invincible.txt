"I, I'm invincible
I'm indestructible
It's my destiny
I, I'm invincible
I'm unshakable
Through the truth in my soul

Chorus:
You know you just can't kill a man when he's dead
You know the spirit survives (invincible)
You can't stop the advance of the Kingdom to come
You know the truth is alive (invincible)

To be invincible
Is unattainable
Without sacrifice
Feel, feel the birth inside
The life that cannot die
Are you invincible

(Chorus)

Invincible-invincible
You know you can't kill a man when he's dead
You know you can't

(Chorus) repeat

You know you can't kill a man when he's dead"
