VERSE 1
Your burden it is easy and Your yoke it is light
You are meek and lowly, You are gentle, You are kind
Every one of Your commands, they lead my heart to life
When I obey, I find life

CHORUS
It's my joy to love, it's my joy to obey
You can have all my heart, You can have all my praise
I will give You my life, I will run hard this race
Reaching for the prize, I am Yours and You are mine

VERSE 2
Teach me all Your ways, O God, please show me Your path
Come unite my heart to fear Your name
Let there be no sin in me that would keep me from this prize
It's because I love I will obey

CHORUS
It's my joy to love, it's my joy to obey
You can have all my heart, You can have all my praise
I will give You my life, I will run hard this race
Reaching for the prize, I am Yours and You are mine

BRIDGE
I will run in the path of Your commands
You will surely enlarge my heart
I will make Your law daily my delight
Let me not wander from Your ways
Let it be my delight to obey
There is no greater joy than knowing Your name

CHORUS
It's my joy to love, it's my joy to obey
You can have all my heart, You can have all my praise
I will give You my life, I will run hard this race
Reaching for the prize, I am Yours and You are mine

TAG
I'm beginning to see, these boundary lines
Were meant for me, so I could find
All of these treasures, hidden inside
A holy God
