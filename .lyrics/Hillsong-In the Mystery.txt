In Your Name
There is hope when all seems lost
There is freedom in the power of the cross
Let the world see

(Verse 2)
In Your Name
There is truth where logic fails
Understanding that makes sense of our days
You Are Worthy

(Pre-Chorus)
Hear the song of all creation roar
We're crying out as One
To You our God
Now show us the way of Your love
And we will come running

(Chorus)
All for Jesus' name
Your love displayed
We are alive in the mystery
All for sinners' gain
Your life You gave
We'll sing Your praise for eternity

(Verse 3)
In Your Name
There is mercy without end
Overtaking us now time and again
Let the world see

(Verse 4)
In Your Name
There is love that never fails
And the promise that Your word will prevail

(Pre-Chorus)
Hear the song of all creation roar
We're crying out as One
To You our God
Now show us the way of Your love
And we will come running

(Chorus)
All for Jesus' name
Your love displayed
We are alive in the mystery
All for sinners' gain
Your life You gave
We'll sing Your praise for eternity (x2)

.... Hear us sing

(Bridge)
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Great is Your Name
Great is Your Name

(PC, Chorus and Bridge again and againâ€¦)
