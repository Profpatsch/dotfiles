[Verse 1]
Perfection is her goal
The passion’s in her soul
fashion is her necessity

The model’s dedication
Dress for visual sensation
Expression of her alamodality

[Chorus]
An icon in the industry
Creator of ideal beauty
Top of her trade
But nothing satisfies

Got to adjust the dress
Needs more makeup for the best
Perfect
By artificial lies

[Verse 2]
Eyeliner and blush
Her schedule keeps her in a rush
Perfection to find in all haste

Wunderbar, it’s time
Lights and the look are really fine
Natural potential gone to waste
