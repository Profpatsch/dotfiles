I've been holding back my rhyme to long,
let it go and unleash the fury of my old school flow.
I'm no superstar more like a John Doe.
But i'm badder then the water down in Mexico.
Oh no, a rock n' roller man who's not allowed to be rap.
But i write what I like and I like the boom bap.
The rhyme's in the front and the beat's in the back
a trunk full of funk and a page full of fact.

Right about now i'd like to hear everyone say.
YES O YES we shall overcome.
My fans got a job,
are we gonna get it done?
YES O YES we shall overcome.

I can't be shy I've gotta come with it.
No fear here! I Sing and bring it.
In christ you've got no right livin' timid.
He's light in the dark and hope for the wicked.
There's a land of the dead called planet earth
and a race called man walks dead from birth
and the beast and man both bear the curse.
Come from the womb but retrun to dirt.

Right about now i'd like to hear everyone say.
YES O YES we shall overcome.
My fans got a job, are we gonna get it done?
Yes O yes we shall over come.

Here's what I do I hope I get through.
So cling to what's true and tell the world too.
Cause some live in fear, oppresddion from peers.
These kids smoke weed, these kids that drink beers
who don't want to hear what you got to say
and they shut their ears and laugh cause you pray,
but don't be afraid, that used to be me I used to mock God
but I was empty.

Right about now i'd like to hear everyone say.
YES O YES we shall over come.
My fans got a job, are we gonna get it done?
YES O YES we shall overcome
