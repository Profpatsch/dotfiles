I saw you kicking apple trees, I wondered why 
The apples fell, but not the leaves 
I came to you, my voice was soft. You asked: “Is there something wrong?”
“Yes” I said, but “no” I thought 

Hold you close to me 
The apple of my eye 
Just give me a chance 
And together we will lie 
Underneath the trees 
wind blowing overhead 
Knowing how we feel 
So nothing more is said 

You saw me looking at the sky, you asked me how 
how it felt, to really fly 
I’d take you there, up off the ground, but I like it here 
“Here” has you, and you I’ve found. 

Hold you close to me 
The apple of my eye 
Just give me a chance 
And together we will lie 
Underneath the trees 
wind blowing overhead 
Knowing how we feel 
So nothing more is said 
Knowing how we feel 
So nothing more is said 

I came to you, my voice was soft. You asked: “Is there something wrong?”
“no” I said, and “no” I thought 
You asked me if I feel alone, on the ground 
if I have you, I’m right at home
