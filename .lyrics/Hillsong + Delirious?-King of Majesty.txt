You know that I love you
You know that I want to
Know you so much more 
More than I have before

These words are from my heart 
These words are not made up 
I will live for you
I am devoted to you

King of Majesty I have one desire 
Just to be with you my lord 
Just to be with you my lord

Jesus you are the Saviour of my soul
And for ever and ever I'll give my praises to you


You know that I love you
You know that I want to
Know you so much more 
More than I have before

These words are from my heart 
These words are not made up 
I will live for you
I am devoted to you

King of Majesty I have one desire 
Just to be with you my lord 
Just to be with you my lord

Jesus you are the Saviour of my soul
And for ever and ever I'll give my praises to you
Jesus you are the Saviour of my soul
And for ever and ever I'll give my praises to you

King of Majesty I have one desire 
Just to be with you my lord 
Just to be with you my lord

And for ever and ever I'll give my praises to you
