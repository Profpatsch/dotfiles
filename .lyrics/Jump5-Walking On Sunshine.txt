I used to think maybe you loved me 
Now, baby, I'm sure 
And I just can't wait 'til the day 
When you knock on my door 
Now every time I go to the mailbox 
Gotta hold myself down (every time I go, gotta hold myself down)
'Cause I just can't wait 'til you write me 
You're coming around

Chorus: 

I'm walking on sunshine, woh, oh 
I'm walking on sunshine, woh, oh 
I'm walking on sunshine, woh, oh 
And time to feel good
Hey,alright now
And time to feel good 
(Walking on sunshine)

I used to think maybe you loved me 
Now I know that it's true
But I just can't spend my whole life 
Just a waiting for you 
I don't want you back for the weekend 
No back for a day (want you back for the weekend, back for just)
'Cause baby I just want you back 
And I want you to stay (and I want you to stay)

I'm walking on sunshine, woh, oh
I'm walking on sunshine, woh, oh
I'm walking on sunshine, woh, oh
And don't it feel good!!
Hey, alright now
And time to feel good!!
