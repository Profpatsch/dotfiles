Our God is an awesome God
He reigns from heaven above

When He rolls up His sleeves
He ain't just puttin' on the ritz
our God is an awesome God
There is thunder in His footsteps
And lightning in His fist
our God is an awesome God
Well, the Lord wasn't joking
When He kicked 'em out of Eden
It wasn't for no reason that He shed his blood
His return is very close and so you better be believing
that our God is an awesome God

Our God is an awesome God
He reigns from heaven above
With wisdom pow'r and love

And when the sky was starless in the void of the night
our God is an awesome God
He spoke into the darkness and created the light
our God is an awesome God
Judgment and wrath he poured out on to Sodom
Mercy and grace He gave us at the cross
I hope that we have not too quickly forgotten that
our God is an awesome God


Our God is an awesome God
He reigns from heaven above
With wisdom pow'r and love
our God is an awesome God

Our God is an awesome God
He reigns from heaven above
With wisdom pow'r and love
our God is an awesome God
