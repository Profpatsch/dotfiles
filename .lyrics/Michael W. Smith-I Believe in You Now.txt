(Once upon a time)
Once upon a time
I was faithless, running blind
Through the valley of the lost

So now you find it rather strange
When you hear me claim the name
Of the one who bears the cross

And I say
I believe in You now
A new light is showing me how
I used to walk in the shadows of doubt
But I believe in You now

(Will there ever)
Will there ever come a day
When you follow in the way
Of the truth that sets you free

To where the thunder of a voice
And the echo of a choice
Will bring you to your knees

No longer running through the night
A conversion to the light
Giving way to disbelief

And you say
I believe in You now
(Oh, I believe in You)
A new light is showing me how
(Yes, I believe in You)
I used to walk in the shadows of doubt
(I believe in You)
But I believe in You now

I believe, I believe in love
I believe, I believe in you
I believe, I believe in love
I believe, I believe in you

I believe in You now
(Oh, I believe in You)
A new light is showing me how
(Yes, I believe in You)
I used to walk in the shadows of doubt
(I believe in You)
But I believe in You now

I believe in You now
(Oh, I believe in You)
Yes, I believe in You now
I'm saying this
I believe in You now
I believe
I believe in You now
Yes, I do
