Who makes 
The sun light up my shadows 
When the darkness tries to follow me? 
Who makes 
The air that brings me life 
So I can breathe the love that's given to me? 

You make ev'rything good, 
Ev'rything wonderful. 
You grace my days 
And heaven fills my view. 
Let's forever sing. 
You make ev'rything pure, 
Ev'rything beautiful. 
You make me see the only thing that's true: 
It's You, 
It's You. 

Who makes 
The waters of my sorrow part 
And leads the gladness into my heart? 
Who makes 
The rivers run that wash away 
And clean my soul to make a new start? 

You make ev'rything good, 
Ev'rything wonderful. 
You grace my days 
And heaven fills my view. 
Let's forever sing. 
You make ev'rything pure, 
Ev'rything beautiful. 
You make me see the only thing that's true: 
It's You. 

You hung the moon; 
You placed the stars that shine Your love for me. 
I hope all that I do 
Will show reflections of You. 
All I do, all for You, shine Your love through me. 

You make ev'rything good, 
Ev'rything wonderful. 
You grace my days 
And heaven fills my view. 
Let's forever sing. 
You make ev'rything pure, 
Ev'rything beautiful. 
You make me see the only thing that's true, 
It's You, it's You, it's You. 
You're ev'rything pure and beautiful.
