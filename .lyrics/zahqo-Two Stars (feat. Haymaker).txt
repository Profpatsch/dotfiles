If I think about all these old moments
If I knew that they’d ever go away
I might never have really enjoyed them
The way those younger days are meant to be

But if I look for you to guide me...

All I see are two bright stars
All I know is you’re too far
To reach, hold or be there
Just lit by your faded glow

All I see are two bright stars
At the end that’s all we are
Your love gets left behind you
It shows us where our steps should go

If can still feel like you had just been stolen
From out of my life again
If I let my thought drift to those places
I might let a tear or two be blessed 
By starlight

All I see are two bright stars
All I know is you’re too far
To reach, hold or be there
Just lit by your faded glow

All I see are two bright stars
At the end that’s all we are
Your love gets left behind you
It shows us where our steps should go
