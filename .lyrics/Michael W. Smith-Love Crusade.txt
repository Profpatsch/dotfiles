Brother, haven't you noticed
There's a war on the soul of man
Hey there, sister
The world is reaching
It could use a helping hand
So come on
No dues are needed
Just a kind heart will be enough
There's a hunger
But you can feed it
Sign the card and join the club
Bridge
We are drawing from an ancient solution
We're embarking on a new regime
We are calling for a new revolution
Be part of the parade
Get on the Love Crusade

Chorus:
Na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na

Jesus said love your neighbor
Like you would love yourself
Get together
Do Him a favor
Give your love to someone else

Bridge II
Just a little sets the wheels in motion
A little more and we could change the world
You can shine a light if you have the notion
So get out of the shade
Get on the Love Crusade

Chorus

Rap:
Come on everyone
There's a lot that can be done
A little love can go a long, long way
So rise to the occasion
Of a radical invasion
(Hey) Don't let the world go down in flames
Fight the fire with a fire
Push it to the limit
And be a renegade
Light a fuse-make a spark
Try to penetrate a heart
There's a burning need to fill the world with love
Love is kind, love is sound
It makes the world go round
So it keep it turning
There could never be enough
Hatred'll spoil the feast
That's the nature of the beast
So don't ever let your heart be swayed
Draw the sword, slay the dragon
Get on the bandwagon
And be a fighter on the Love Crusade

Bridge I

Chorus
