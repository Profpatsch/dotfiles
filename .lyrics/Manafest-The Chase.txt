Ntro: I can't stop the chase.... I can't stop the chase...

Verse I

Always feel like I'm on the run
Feel guilty when I'm having fun
Only work seems to turn me on
Burning out, and I've just begun
Brain won't stop, chase the clock
Race to the top take it all
Girl I know, I need to come home
In my world surrounded alone
If I could you know I would
Knock on wood I know I should
Slow it down, one more round
See this crowd let me rock them out

CHORUS:

I'm in the middle of the race
Can't stop the chase
They're pulling away

I got to be on top
My dreams on lock
They won't let go of me

I can't stop the chase
It's too late can't turn it off, till I reach the top won't ever stop
Til you know my name
Got to keep the pace, cause your never gonna stop the chase

I can't stop the chase, I can't stop the chase

Verse II

Still going Yup,
Haven't talked to myself in awhile
Touring round, round, mashed out
Don't want let me down
Now(hah) spitted, with uh, kicked with ah
Freestyle, can anybody huh, freak me out
When I'm on stage I get so wild
Cause I got great faith, stepping in late, I stayed straight
I got it made it's just my destiny---- UH

CHORUS:

I'm in the middle of the race
Can't stop the chase
They're pulling away

I got to be on top
My dreams on lock
They won't let go of me

I can't stop the chase
It's too late can't turn it off, till I reach the top won't ever stop
Until you know my name
Got to keep the pace cause your never gonna stop the chase

Verse III

I woke up in a sweat again
Choked up from the medicine
Can't sleep keep wrestling
Success is so dangerous
If I chill can't pay the bills
If I'm ill can't spit the real
Some would kill for the life I live
Some will build sacrifice and win
Chased them all faced them all
Paced the hallway walls and brawled
Just no way I can turn it off; but
Some how always turn back to God
