Verse 1
I've heard of Your great fame 
and Your glory oh God (Isaiah 66:19) 
How You stretched out Your hand to make
the waters and the skies (Psalms 95:5; 136:6) 
with one Word You spoke out 
and Your voice created light (Genesis 1:3) 
and from dust You made man 
and gave Him the breath of life (Genesis 2:7) 

Bridge 
There is none to compare 
to your great love oh God (Isaiah 40:18)
You alone are worthy of every breath 
I've got (Psalms 18:3; Revelation 4:11) 

Chorus  
So God I come before You 
to worship and adore You (Psalm 95:6) 
I pray You send Your power 
Holy Spirit fall upon me (Acts 1:8) 

Verse 2  
The whole earth and the heavens 
sing of Your glory (Psalms 148:4; 150:6)  
and the angels all around You are
crying out holy (Revelation 4:8) 
what an awesome God that You are
that You even thought of me (Psalm 8:4) 
for you know me (Psalm 139:23) 
and you love me (1 John 4:10) 
and You gave me everything (Luke 15:31; John 3:16)
