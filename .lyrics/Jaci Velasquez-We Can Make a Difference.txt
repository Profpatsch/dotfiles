Do do do do do
Do do do do do
Do do do do do do do 
Repeat 

Come on now

We live in a dream
If we really think
Everything's alright

(yeah)

This world is in need
Crying out to be freed
We gotta shed some light

(oh)

Teach the world to smile
(And hear angels sing)
Feel the breath of God
(And the power it brings)
It's time to come together, you and I
And share the love of Jesus Christ

Chorus:
We can make a difference
We can make a change
We can make the world a better place
We can make a difference
We can make a change
We can make the sun shine through the rain
Shine on through the rain

Do do do do do
Do do do do do
Do do do do do do do

Do you know a man
Who's needing a hand?
Don't ya walk on by

(oh)

A sister is sad
Lost all that she had
We gotta take the time

(oh)

Look around your world
(It will testify)
Some have empty hearts
(Some have hungry eyes)
God can heal the suffering through our hands
Find compassion, take a stand

Repeat Chorus

Do do do do do
Do do do do do
Do do do do do do do 
Repeat 

Teach the world to smile
(And hear angels sing)
Feel the breath of God
(And the power it brings)
It's time to come together, you and I
And share the love of Jesus Christ

Repeat Chorus

We can make a difference
(Shine oh)
Make a change
(Come on now, shine on through it)
We can make a difference, difference, difference
(We can make a difference)
We can make a change

We can make a difference difference, difference
yeah, yeah
