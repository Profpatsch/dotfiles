'Twas the night before Christmas
And up at the North Pole
Everybody's going crazy
Everything's out of control

The toy shop is on fire
The toys melting on the shelves
And you can hear Mrs. Claus scream
"One can never trust those elves!"

Unless something drastic happens fast
Say hello to the ghost of Christmas past
Because, Rudoph's puking boughs of holly
Old Saint Nick ain't all that jolly
And the sleigh's in the shop.
'Cause it's broken down
But Christmas won't stop
'Cause Santa Claus is thumbing to town
Santa Claus is thumbing to town
Santa Claus is thumbing to town
Santa Claus is thumbing to town
Very much to his disliking
Santa spends all night hitch-hiking
With a sign that reads, "Ho ho slow down,"
Santa Claus is thumbing to town

Every car just drove right past him
And sped right out of sight
Santa never got to ask them
To drive around the world in just one night

So Kris Kringle started walkin' 
Through the snow without his sleigh
Shed a tear for every stocking
That would be empty Christmas day

Unless something drastic happens fast
Say hello to the ghost of Christmas past
Because, mistletoe and boughs of holly!
Old Saint Nick ain't all that jolly
And the sleigh's in the shop
'Cause it's broken down
But Christmas won't stop
'Cause Santa Claus is thumbing to town
Santa Claus is thumbing to town
Santa Claus is thumbing to town
Santa Claus is thumbing to town
Very much to his disliking
Santa spends all night hitch-hiking
With a sign that reads, "Ho ho slow down,"
Santa Claus is thumbing to town
Santa Claus is thumbing to town
