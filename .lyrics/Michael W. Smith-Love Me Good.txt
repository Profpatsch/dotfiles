Sometimes I feel like this world is just one big gigantic merry-go-round 
You gotta hold on tight or you get hurled through the air 
Yeah, life is a 3 ring circus with clowns and freaks and camels and such 
And you never know when you might be attacked by the bears 

Give me love, give me love 
Love me good 
Give me love, give me love 
Love me good 

Give me love, give me love 
Love me good 
Give me love, give me love 
Love me good 

Sometimes I feel like I'm afraid of my own shadow and then 
Sometimes I can feel as bold as Genghis Khan 
But I could never live in a yurt on a diet of Mongolian barbecue 
I conquer the world for a moment then the moment is gone 

Give me love, give me love 
Love me good 
Give me love, give me love 
Love me good 

Give me love, give me love 
Love me good 
Give me love, give me love 
Love me good 

Give me love, give me love 
Love me good 
Give me love, give me love 
Love me good 

Give me love, give me love 
Love me good 
Give me love, give me love 
Love me good 

Let us take a moment now to bow our heads and pray 
If only to give thanks for making it through another day 

Sometimes I wish I was in a movie or some 70's TV thing 
Where everything gets neatly wrapped by the end of the show 
Yeah, but this ain't Hollywood and this sure ain't the 'Brady Bunch' 
And how this plot's gonna all pan out I don't really know 

Give me love, give me love 
Love me good 
Give me love, give me love 
Love me good 

Give me love, give me love 
Love me good 
Give me love, give me love 
Love me good 

Oh, love me good 
Yeah, love me good 
Oh, love me good 
Yeah, love me good 

Oh, love me good 
Yeah, love me good 
Oh, love me good 
Yeah, love me good 

Love me good, yeah hey 
Love me, love me, love me good
