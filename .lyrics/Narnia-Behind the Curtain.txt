In this land
Where nights are long and sun won't shine
It's getting cold
No one cares
No one listens to You anymore
So many hearts are closed

But in every corner lies
In shattered dreams and lies
A need to come back home

When I opened up my eyes
You made me realize
That life goes on behind the curtain
Life goes on

Through new eyes
I've seen so many different colors
Not everything is clear

But in every corner lies
In shattered dreams and lies
A need to come back home

When I opened up my eyes
You made me realize
That life goes on behind the curtain
Life goes on

Hear me, speak to me
Don't leave me here all alone
Face me, embrace me
I pray You'll be there when I fall... I fall...

When I opened up my eyes
You made me realize
That life goes on behind the curtain

Will I laugh or will I cry?
Will I live or will I die?
Will I face tomorrow without sorrow?

When I opened up my eyes
You made me realize
That life goes on behind the curtain

Will I laugh or will I cry?
Will I live or will I die?
Will I face tomorrow without sorrow?

Will I laugh or will I cry?
Will I live or will I die?
Will I face tomorrow without sorrow?
