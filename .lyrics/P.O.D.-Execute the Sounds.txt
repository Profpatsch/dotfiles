I man a mad stylee, ungerground
We come cool and deadly, with that natural sound 
It make you feel so free, you no turn it down
Vibes 619 from the Southtown
And Jah know, what I & I gonna do
Because Jah know, I man stay true 
You know Jah know, the real who is who
Ain't no time to fake it, make it feel brand new
It goes 1,2,3 the crew is called P.O.D.
And if you want to go to the tiptop
Break it down with that one drop

Chorus:
Execute the sounds
Positive come around
Impact the sounds
Positive all around

You want to mess with me, try to take this crown
Babylon test we, me go smash them down
Original O.G., this is my playground
No take me seriously, you gonna feel it now
I man know the harder they come
Because I man a gonna get the job done
You know I man know they don't want none
Me never cheat, 'cause me already won
1904, home to the real hardcore
And you don't want to sleep, don't talk
I'll break you down with that one drop

Chorus
