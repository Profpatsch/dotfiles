Well, everyone needs compassion
A love that's never failing
Let mercy fall on me
Well, everyone needs forgiveness
The kindness of a Saviour
The hope of nations

Saviour, He can move the mountains
For my God is mighty to save, He is mighty to save
Forever, author of Salvation
Where He rose and conquered the grave, Jesus conquered the grave

So take me as You find me
All my fears and failures, fill my life again
I give my life to follow
Everything I believe in, now I surrender
I surrender

Oh

Saviour, He can move the mountains
For my God is mighty to save, He is mighty to save
Forever, author of Salvation
Where He rose and conquered the grave, Jesus conquered the grave

Saviour, He can move the mountains
For my God is mighty to save, He is mighty to save
Forever, author of Salvation
He rose and conquered the grave, Jesus conquered the grave

Shine Your light, and let the whole world see, we're singing 
For the glory of the risen King, Jesus
Shine Your light, and let the whole world see, we're singing 
For the glory of the risen King, Jesus

Saviour, He can move the mountains
For my God is mighty to save, He is mighty to save
Forever, author of Salvation
He rose and conquered the grave, Jesus conquered the grave

Saviour, He can move the mountains
For my God is mighty to save, He is mighty to save
Forever, author of Salvation
He rose and conquered the grave, Jesus conquered the grave

Shine Your light, and let the whole world see, we're singing 
For the glory of the risen King, Jesus
