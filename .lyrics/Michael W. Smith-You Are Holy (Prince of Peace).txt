I will sing to
And worship
The King who is worthy

And I will bow down before Him
And I will sing to and worship the King who is worthy 
And I will love and adore him 
And I will bow down before Him
You're my prince of peace
And I will live my life for You

You're my savior, messiah, redeemer, and friend
