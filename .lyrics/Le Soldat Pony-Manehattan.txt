I wake up one morning
But now without my friends
Everypony just drifts away

I see the city
Oh, and helpless I stand
Our lives change easy as molding clay

[Chorus]
Home, come take me home
Through the wind and the rain
Blades cut to the bone
Run to your river, run to your plain

Iâ€™ll never know
Just why I ran
Went out to see that city bright

I know my sight is small,
But wherever I stand
The city keeps me from the light

[Chorus]
