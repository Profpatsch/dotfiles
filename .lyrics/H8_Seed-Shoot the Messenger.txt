You pride yourself on being rather shrewd
And yet you never show me gratitude
I'm sick and tired of playing your dumb game
I'm hurt and you're the one to blame

I just wanna will it away
But even now, you taunt me still
You pretend to think it's okay
That I'm the one that holds your quill

I hope when you think about the things you say
That you know you need me; I don't need you
And you knew not to shoot your messenger
(Well, if you didn't, then now you do)

I just wanna will it away
But even now, you taunt me still
You pretend to think it's okay
That I'm the one that holds your quill
