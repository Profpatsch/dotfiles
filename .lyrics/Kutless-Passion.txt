Within my mind's eye
Flickering from the past
Come images that terrify and calm
A paradox in me

Nail-pierced hands, they run with blood
A splitting brow forced by the thorns
His face is writhing with the pain
Yet it's comforting to me

He chose to give it all
Jesus endured the pain
Paying a debt I owed and createing
a paradox in me

Nail-pierced hands, they run with blood
A splitting brow forced by the thorns
His face is writhing with the pain
Yet it's comforting to me

And in my heart I know that You're the only one
Who could have came and died, a sacrifice
As You're God's only Son

Nail-pierced hands, they run with blood
A splitting brow forced by the thorns
His face is writhing with the pain
Yet it's comforting to me
