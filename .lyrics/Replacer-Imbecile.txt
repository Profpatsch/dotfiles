Well my wings are all I need now, I swear to Her I live in style 
Come here, close your eyes and maybe stay a while 
Let me introduce you to an imbecile 
Imbecile 

Well you're gonna have to wait round if you want to see me fly 
Watch close, look beyond the friendship in your eye 
Don't worry please and if you have to let me die 
Please be still 

One pegasus to hold off the rain who thinks he has it tough 
No option but to break a heart so he flies away 
Six ponies move together, Equestria will be enough 
With two to rule and oversee the night and the day 

You'll be wise to watch your step if you want to walk the clouds with me 
Take flight before the whole thing ends in tragedy 
Don't be afraid, so much remains for you to see
