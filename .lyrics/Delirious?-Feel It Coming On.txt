Look at where we've come
a boy becomes a man
But for the first time in our lives
we come without a plan
Careful when you look
for my heart has leprosy
All I want is to see Jesus
just one touch and I'll be free

Oh, I feel, I feel it's coming on
When you call my name it feels like heaven

Reach inside of me
deeper than before
Would you tear away this old man
bring peace to this old war
See your piercing eyes
burn me like a fire
If you have me I will run
to finish all that you've begun

Hold me tonight, will you hold me tonight
Hold me tonight, it feels like heaven
