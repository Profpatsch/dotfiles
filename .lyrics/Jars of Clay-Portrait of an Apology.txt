Look what I've done
This picture I've painted
It looks like my heart
Or what still remains
Convinced of the weight
Your interpretations
Are not what I see
I wish they could be

But I remember it much redder
And I remember it much brighter

Can you stay for a while
Try to imagine this
Could you be for a while
I can't remember it
Could you fall for a while
'Cause I can't escape from this

Try to explain
The way that the frame
Doesn't quite fit the image
Or surround the edge
It stands on display
What do you see
Behold all the new grey
What's become of the old me

'Cause I remember it much redder
And I remember it much brighter

Can you stay for a while
Try to imagine this
Could you be for a while
I can't remember it
Could you fall for a while
'Cause I can't escape from this

Can you stay for a while
Calling, crying, ashamed of what I am not
Really failing, falling into this cage and I can't escape
No, I can't escape
No, I can't

So look what I've done
Picture I've painted
Doesn't quite fit
Or surround the edge
But I remember it much redder

Try to imagine this
Could you be for a while
'Cause I can't remember it
Could you fall for a while
I can't escape from this

Can you stay for a while
'Cause I can't escape
Could you be for a while
For a while
For a while
For a while

I can't, I can't escape

Can you stay for a while
Could you be for a while
Could you fall for a while

No, I can't, I can't escape

Can you stay for a while
Could you be for a while
Could you fall for a while

Can you be 
Can you stay
