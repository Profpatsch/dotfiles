I think I'm changing my mind 
Need to follow myself 
I don't know what I'll find 

You think I'm going astray 
But I promise you now 
Nothing happened today 

There's one thing I request of you now 
To join me when I fly 
Equestria is vast and unknown 
It's easy if you try 

I think I'm changing my style 
Need to find a new place 
And it's making me smile 

When everything becomes new 
I hope I will be there 
And I'm counting on you 

There's one thing I request of you now 
To join me when I fly 
Equestria is vast and unknown 
It's easy if you try
