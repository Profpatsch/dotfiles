We're getting stronger every day 
We're getting braver in every way
Hallelujah, here we come

We're getting stronger every day
Push through the waves that fall our way 
Hallelujah, here we come
We're much stronger when we're one 
Hallelujah, here we come

Oh, I love You from the depths of my heart
And nothing here will tear us apart
Everything's beautiful with You 
Everything's beautiful when You invade my life
And I'm living just to say that I love You

We're getting closer every day
Chasing the dreams that heaven gave
Hallelujah, here we come, yeah

We're getting closer every day
Into Your arms I'm here to stay
We're much stronger when we're one
Hallelujah here we come

Oh, I love You from the depths of my heart
And nothing here will tear us apart
Everything's beautiful with You 
Everything's beautiful when You invade my life
And I'm living just to say that I love You

Yes I love You
Oh, I love You now
Oh, yes, I love you
