Lord, how lovely is Your name 
You are everyday the same 
You are worthy 
Lord, come and fill our emptiness 
With the beauty of Your holiness 
Now, we will sing Your praise 
And declare Your ways to be holy 

Lord, we love and proclaim 
The Holiest name 
Of God in the highest 
Lord, above every name 
No other can claim 
The Holiest name of all 

Grace has been given unto us 
We have nothing else to trust 
But Your mercy 
Your love has called us to Your side 
We will faithfully abide in You 
And now we will heed Your voice 
And our hearts rejoice in Your glory 

Lord, we love and proclaim 
The Holiest name 
Of God in the highest 
Lord, above every name 
No other can claim 
The Holiest name of all 

The Holiest name 

The Holiest name of all...
