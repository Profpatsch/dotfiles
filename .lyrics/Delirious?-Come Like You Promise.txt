This is the sound of the secret place
This is the sound that the angels sing
This is the sound of the coming rain
This is the sound of my heart's desire
This is the sound that my spirit sings
This is the sound of the coming rain
Come, like you promise

This is the groan from the deepest place
This is the incense that fills the earth
This is the sound of the coming rain
This is the sound of the hope within
This is the song that the prophet sings
This is the sound of the coming rain

Come, like you promise
These are the words that creation cries
These are the songs of injustice and pain
This is the sound of the coming rain
Come, like you promise
