The rock are going to cry out if we don't
 Now's the time to raise a song
 Hear creation shout loud
 We will join our voices to the sound
 Stand up, stand up the time has come
 
Sing it out, sing an anthem to His name
 A generation worshipping unashamed
 Giving all for the glory of our King
 We will run, we will run after Your heart
 We believe You all that You say You are
 Giving all for the glory of our King
 The glory of our King
 
The church is waking up now
 To be Your Hands and feet upon this earth
 Send us in Your power 
As we take Heaven to a broken world
 
We are, we are a chosen
 We are, we are called to follow
 We are, we are Your generation
 You are, You are the God who saves us
 You are, You are the God who sends us
 You are, You are the God who's with us
