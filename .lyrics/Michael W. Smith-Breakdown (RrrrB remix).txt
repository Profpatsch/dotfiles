Wasn't it long ago
Wasn't it on a New England coast
Wasn't it the standard - people praying to
The Son and the Father and the Holy Ghost
One nation over God
Is that what we've now become?
The founding fathers left a noble legacy
To their sons and daughters
To their sons and daughters
Look at what we've done
Look at what we've done

Chorus:
Breakdown, breakdown, breakdown
As we learn to bite the hand
That tries to feed us
Breakdown, breakdown, breakdown
If we say that we are free
Who will believe us
If we breakdown, breakdown, breakdown
Breakdown, break

See the powder on the glass
See the pillow on the street
See the charter of a modern love
With no obligations...or promises to meet

Hear the fear of disease
Hear the baby never born
Hear a people crying out
"Somebody save us - oh, please somebody save us
From what we're headed for - from what we're headed for"

Chorus

Breakdown, breakdown, breakdown
As we learn to bite the hand
That tries to feed us
Breakdown, breakdown, breakdown

Chorus
