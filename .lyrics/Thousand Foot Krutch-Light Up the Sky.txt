Watch me light up the sky
Light up the sky
Watch me light up the sky
Light up the sky

Hands held high, sweat dripping off me
Light it softly, got these fakers trying to stop me
This ain't a hobby, it's a way of life just like
Holyfield and Tyson, gloves on, fight night
Boom, here comes the hurricane, monsoon
Switched up, came to redecorate the room
My ears are ringing from hearing the same sound
So what now? All the walls just came down

I blaze the trail like
The race from taillights
Sound shaking the ground
Like earthquakes and hail might
Someday I'll die, but not tonight
Excuse me while I light up the sky

Light up the sky
Light up the sky
Watch me light up the sky
Light up the sky

Game-time, ripping, mint-condition
Lights out, stopping all competition
My utmost to His highest, it gets no flyer
Uh-oh, we set the mainframe on fire
Boom, code-red, feel the lead from the pedal
I push to the metal, the dust never settles
And for five levels, kick up the bass and the treble
'Cause faith, that's a rebel, I can show you the devil

I blaze the trail like
The race from taillights
Sound shaking the ground
Like earthquakes and hail might
Someday I'll die, but not tonight
Excuse me while I light up the sky

Light up the sky
Light up the sky
Watch me light up the sky
Light up the sky

Nowhere else have I seen 
Such lions led by lambs
So if you're not afraid of it
Stand up and take my hand
(Light up the sky)
We got a battle up front, but beyond
That's the promised land
And when we all shout together
Man, believe me, they'll understand

Nowhere else have I seen

So if you're not afraid of it
Stand up and take my hand

Man, believe me, they'll understand

I blaze the trail like
The race from taillights
Sound shaking the ground

Someday I'll die, but not tonight
Excuse me while I light up the sky

Light up the sky
Light up the sky
Watch me light up the sky
Light up the sky

Excuse me while I light up the sky
