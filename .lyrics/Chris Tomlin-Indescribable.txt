From the highest of heights
To the depths of the sea
Creation's revealing Your majesty
From the colors of Fall
To the fragrance of Spring
Every creature unique 
And the song that it sings
All exclaiming --

Indescribable, uncontainable
You placed the stars in the sky
And You know them by name
You are amazing, God
All powerful, untamable
Awestruck, we fall to our knees
As we humbly proclaim
You are amazing, God

Who has told every lightning bolt
Where it should go?
Or seen heavenly storehouses 
Laden with snow?
Who imagined the sun
And gives source to its light?
Yet conceals it to bring us the coolness of night
None can fathom...

Indescribable, uncontainable
You placed the stars in the sky
And You know them by name
You are amazing, God
Incomparable, unchangeable 
You see the depths of my heart
And You love me the same
You are amazing, God
You are amazing God 

Indescribable, uncontainable
You placed the stars in the sky
And You know them by name
You are amazing, God
All powerful, untamable
Awestruck, we fall to our knees
As we humbly proclaim
You are amazing, God

Indescribable, uncontainable
You placed the stars in the sky
And You know them by name
You are amazing, God
Incomparable, unchangeable 
You see the depths of my heart
And You love me the same
You are amazing, God
You are amazing God
