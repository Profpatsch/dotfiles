Say what you want
Mean what you say
Remember the deepest seeds still find the light of day
Do as you please
And be who you be
I'm telling you this thing's gonna bring you to your knees, yeah 

CHORUS
The truth is what we need, it is the end 
Of mystery
You know the truth will set you free
The truth is out there
The truth is out there

I am living proof 
That the Spirit moves
It's a Holy interceding absolute
(Say what you want)
Say what you want but you've got to believe
(got to believe)
There's a dimension that eyes haven't seen
(eyes haven't seen)
The secret is out and people are coming clean
(people are coming clean)

CHORUS

BRIDGE
The truth is out there
(Our search is not in vain)
The truth is out there
(God has prepared a way)
The truth is out there
(To save the human race...out there)

Say what you want, but you've got to believe
There's a dimension that eyes haven't seen
The secret is out and God knows I'm coming clean

CHORUS
The truth
Is what we need it is the end
Of mystery
The truth will set you free
The truth 
Is what we need it is the end
Of mystery
Ya know the truth (the truth will set you free) will set you free

The truth is out there
(out there)
The truth is out there
(it's out there)
For you and me it's out there
(out there)
I believe it's out there
(it's out there)

It's a conspiracy
You know that I believe
It's a conspiracy
You know that I believe

Rescue me...(4x)
