You try to answer slow
You put your head down low
Címon take your time
Try to choose the most believable lie

You try to walk away
And tell me everything's okay
You think youíre are saved by words
But you're drowning in the absurd

But to me it's no big surprise
You thought I never saw your eyes

Departed with a smile
Just like walking down the isle
You shook the preacher's hand
But your smile can't hide your sin
Your eyes tell me what you feel
You eyes tell me what is real
Nobody's perfect is your prediction
Your life is proving your conviction!

To me it's no big surprise
I saw the emptiness in your eyes
