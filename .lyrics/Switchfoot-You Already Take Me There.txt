When all I have is on the floor divided, divided
When I'm a world away from peace
Behind your eyes is where I know 
I'll find it, I'll find it
'Cause who You are defines my dreams

You already take me there 
You already take me there 
You already take me there 
Heaven in the here and now

When I'm a broken-hearted man
Complacent and tired
When I've been knocked out of the race
I've been a fool for long enough 
To fight it, to fight it
It's in your arms I find my place

You already take me there 
You already take me there 
You already take me there 
Heaven in the here and now (now)

You meet me where I am
Forgive me where I am

Where I lose myself in grace
(Where I'm lost and found)
I want to lose myself in grace
Let your love reign down all over me
(Over me)
Cover me

You already take me there
You already take me there 
Heaven in the here and now
Heaven in the here and now
Heaven in the here and now
