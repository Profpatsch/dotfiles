From in the middle of the room 
She hears the conversation moving
Further from where she's going, 
Without even knowing, 
Now the vibrations in the floor,
Are getting closer to the door and,
Is this the way you,
Let your problems drift away to?
I climb, So high, It blows me away sometimes,
See through, my holes, into this place i call my own,
And this time, I'll try, Its in the air tonight,
Sleep tonight, no more crying,
'Cause i've got you on my side

I don't want you to be, anything at all,
I just want you to say you love me,
I don't care, just stop living like this,
I don't want to be, anything at all, 
I just want you to see, who I am, and Stop the Violence
No more silence

From in the middle of the room 
She hears the conversation moving
Further from where she's going, 
Without even knowing, knowing,
Now the vibrations in the floor,
Are getting closer to the door and,
Is this the way you,
Let your problems drift away to?
I climb, So high, It blows me away sometimes,
See through, my holes, into this place i call my own,
And this time, I'll try, Its in the air tonight,
Sleep tonight, no more crying,
'Cause i've got you on my side

I'm gonna show ya I'm alive, 
Breathing clearly for the first time,
Hold me in your arms, take me to the place where you are,
I needed time to clear my mind,
Keeping Balanced on this line,
Was impossible, before I met you,
I climb, so high, It blows me away sometimes,
Sleep tonight, no more cryin,
Cause I've got you on my side

I'll shout form the top of the rooftop singing,
I'm not afraid of the bed I lay in,
Listen to the sound of the voices ringing,
I can't deny it, No more silence,
We'll shout from the top of the roof top singing,
We're not afraid of the bed we lay in,
Listen to the sound of the voices ringing,
I can't deny it, 
NO MORE SILENCE!
