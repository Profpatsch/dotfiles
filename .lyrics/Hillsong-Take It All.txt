Searching the world 
The lost will be found 
In freedom we live 
As one we cry out 
You carried the cross 
You died and rose again 
My God 
I’ll only ever give my all 

You sent Your Son 
From heaven to earth 
You delivered us all 
It’s eternally heard 
I searched for truth 
And all I found was You 
My God 
I’ll only ever give my all 

Jesus we’re living for Your Name 
We’ll never be ashamed of You 
Whoa o oh 
Our praise and all we are today 
Take take take it all 
Take take take it all

Running to the One 
Who heals the blind 
Following the shining light 
In Your hands 
The power to save the world 
In my life
