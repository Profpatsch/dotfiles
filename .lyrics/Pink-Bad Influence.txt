Alright sir 
Sure I'll have another one it's early 
Three olives, shake it up, I like it dirty (dirty) 
Tequila for my friend it makes her flirty (flirty) 
Trust me

I'm the instigator of underwear 
Showing up here and there uh oh (oh no) 
I'm always on a mission from the get-go (get-go) 
So what if it's only one o'clock in the afternoon 
It's never too soon
To send out all the invitations
To the last night of (your life!)

Lordy, Lordy, Lordy! 
I can't help it I like to party, it's genetic! 
It's electrifying
Wind me up and watch me go 
Where she stops, nobody knows 
A good excuse to be
A bad influence on you

And you and you and you and you 
And you and you and you and you
And you and you and you and you
And you and you and you

Alright ma'am (ma'am) 
Calm down I know your son said he was in my house (my house) 
He was the captain of the football team but I turned him out 
He wasn't the first and he won't be the last, so tone it down 
This happens all the time 

I'm a story to tell the alibi 
They wanna go home I asked them (why?) 
It's daylight (not night) 
They might need a break from all the real life (get a life) 
It gets to be too much sometimes 
It's never too late
To send out all the invitations
To the last night of (your life!)

Lordy, Lordy, Lordy! 
I can't help it I like to party, it's genetic! 
It's electrifying
Wind me up and watch me go 
Where she stops, nobody knows 
A good excuse to be
A bad influence on you

And you and you and you and you 
And you and you and you and you
And you and you and you and you
And you and you and you

I'm off to see the doctor 
I hope she has a cure 
I hope she makes me better 
What does that even mean? (we don't know!) 

Lordy, Lordy, Lordy! 
I can't help it I like to party, it's genetic! 
It's electrifying
Wind me up and watch me go 
Where she stops, nobody knows 
A good excuse to be
A bad influence on you

Lordy, Lordy, Lordy! 
I can't help it I like to party, it's genetic! 
It's electrifying
Wind me up and watch me go 
Where she stops, nobody knows 
A good excuse to be
A bad influence on you

Lordy, Lordy, Lordy! 
I can't help it I like to party, it's genetic!

Wind me up and watch me go 
Where she stops, nobody knows 
A good excuse to be
A bad influence on you

And you and you and you and you 
And you and you and you and you
And you and you and you and you
And you and you and you

I'm a good excuse (good excuse) 
To be a bad influence on you and you and you 

You're too tired 
You're not too tired!
