Let's spend it up <i>(feel)</i>

Go out and smash it
Like, oh my God!
Jump off that sofa
Let's get-get... off <i>(feel)</i>

I know that we'll have a ball
If we get down and go out
And just lose it all <i>(feel)</i>

I feel stressed and
I wanna let it go
Let's go way out spaced out
And losing all control <i>(feel)</i>

Fill up my cup

And then we'll do it again <i>(feel)</i>
