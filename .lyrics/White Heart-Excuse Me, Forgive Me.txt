Kerry says to me that I really don't see
I'm making too much of all this morality
This could never offend your heavenly friend
I'm not committing crimes against humanity

Excuse me, forgive me
I'm certain that you do see
Excuse me, forgive me
Not the same thing in my mind
It's one or the other
No they're not together
They've both got their own place in time
So excuse me

I know some things are wrong
I've heard your righteous song
But a lot of these things are only indiscretions
Gotta play it loose, I'll be the one to choose
You can't believe that this would ever
Change my redemption

Excuse me, forgive me
I'm certain that you do see
Excuse me, forgive me
Not the same thing in my mind
It's one or the other
No they're not together
I'll decide which one to use next time

Kerry - in your heart and mind
Something's dying every time you...

It's one or the other
No they're not together
Do you really think that you should
Choose this time

Excuse me, forgive me
