Imagine a place only your soul can vision 
The heart of a child who looks, sees and listens 
Paints a picture using every color 
And what she sees, she sees is like no other

One word, a voice unheard 
You can change the world
With everything I know you're made of
One word, a voice unheard
You can change the world
If everyone would stop and listen

The art of innocence makes so much sense
But placed in the wrong hands, well, then it's wasted
Filtered through the eyes of a pure mind
A one-of-a-kind paradise for you and I, you and I

One word, a voice unheard 
You can change the world
With everything I know you're made of
One word, a voice unheard
You can change the world
(You can change the world)
If everyone would stop and listen
Break the cycle, find your rhythm
Share the gift that you've been given
You can, you can change the world
You can change the world
(You can change the world)

One word, a voice unheard 
You can change the world
(You can change the world)
With everything I know you're made of
One word, a voice unheard
You can change the world
(You can change the world)
If everyone would stop and listen
One word, a voice unheard 
You can change the world
(You can change the world)
With everything I know you're made of
One word, a voice unheard
You can change the world
(You can change the world)
If everyone would stop and listen
