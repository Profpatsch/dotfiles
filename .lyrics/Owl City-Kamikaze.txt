The princess in her flower bed
Pulled the jungle underground
Where cherry bombs stain the blackbirds red
And explosions never make a sound

(O comet come down!)
Kamikaze over me
(And I come alive)
My midnight melody
(O comet come down)

My captain on a snowy horse
Is coming back to take me home
He’ll find me fighting back a terrible force
‘Cause I’m not afraid to die alone

(O comet come down!)
Kamikaze over me
(And I come alive)
My midnight melody
(O comet come down!)
Kamikaze over me
(And I come alive)
My midnight melody
(O comet come down!)

(O comet come, comet come down!)

(Brave down the open road)
Maybe I'll ride
(And fight back the undertow)
To save my life
(Breathe in the amber glow)
Maybe I’ll fly
(And go where you wanna go)
With the eagle eye 

(Brave down the open road)
Maybe I'll ride
(And fight back the undertow)
To save my life
(Breathe in the amber glow)
Maybe I’ll fly
(And go where you wanna go)
With the eagle eye 

Eagle eye, eagle eye
Eagle eye, eagle eye
