You take my rights away
You take control, no stopping You
You take my rights away
I can take it (oh, oh)

See me let it go
You are in control
Suffer as we grow
And we say - we say we don't want to
Holding nothing
You take everything
You're worth anything at all
Anything at all

You take my rights away
You take control, no stopping You
You take my rights away
I can take it (oh, oh)

You define me
With your identity
Lose my life in you
I can take - I'll take what it costs me

You take my rights away
You take control, no stopping You
You take my rights away
I can take it (oh, oh)
