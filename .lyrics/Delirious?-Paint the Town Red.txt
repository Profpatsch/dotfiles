You know I feel there's something
'bout to break now
You know I feel there's a city
Here to take now
And it's not so tough
For these ordinary hands,
When we trust someone
With extraordinary plans

You know i feel this
Hearts about to break now,
'Cos I can see what
The devil's trying to take now,
We've got this leather backed
Book and a freedom cry,
And we're an Army of God
Who are ready to die

You give us hope where hope is gone
You fill the streets with a holy song
We're gonna paint this big old town red.

Oh, here we come, here we come
Oh, here we come, here we come

You know I feel this sky's 
About to break now,
You know I feel our city's 
Gonna shake now
And we hear You call
Every woman and man
"Ring the mission bell."
And storm the gates of hell.

Miracles run from street to street
Rise up church for a holy meet
We're gonna paint this big old town red
We're gonna paint this big old town red
With the blood of Jesus
