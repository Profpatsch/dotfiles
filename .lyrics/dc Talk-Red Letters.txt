Pages filled with a holy message
Sealed with a kiss from heaven
On a scroll long ago
Phrases, words that were bound together
Now have the power to sever
Like a sword evermore 

Heed the words divinely spoken
May your restless heart be broken
Let the supernatural take hold 

There is love in the red letters
There is truth in the red letters
There is hope for the hopeless
Peace and forgiveness
There is life in the red letters
In the red letters 

One man came to reveal a mystery
Changing the course of history
Made the claim he was God
Ageless, born of a virgin Mary
Spoke with a voice that carried through the years
It's persevered 

Heed the words divinely spoken
May your restless heart be broken
Let the supernatural take hold 

There is love in the red letters
There is truth in the red letters
There is hope for the hopeless
Peace and forgiveness
There is life in the red letters
In the red letters 

What You say moves me, revelation, come and take me
The more I look (the more I look) the more I see (the more I see)
The Word of God (the Word Of God) is what I need 

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Yeah, it's the book of love
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It's the book of love
That moves

There is love in the red letters
There is truth in the red letters
There is hope for the hopeless
Peace and forgiveness
There is life in the red letters
In the red letters 

(Waitin' for you)
(Comin' to you)
(Do you see it?)
(I believe it)

Speak to me, breathe in me new life
Speak to me, breathe in me new life 
Let Him in your heart
Let Him in your heart
Let Him in your heart
Let Him in your heart
