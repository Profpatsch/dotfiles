I don't know how to let you go
I've given to you all of me, all that I'll ever be
We share the same heart and soul
I want you to believe in me
See through my eyes and you will know
I'll take my chance that you will come home to me
Even if it takes some time for you to work it out
I'll be there

Chorus:
I still got a ways to go
So far away from home
Inside I always knew
I would find my way to you x2
Find my way.......

If I could be everything you want
If I could change everything that I have done
Only you know where I have gone
I want to prove I am worthy to be called yours
I need you more than I ever have
And I don't want to stay, try and find me if you can
If I get lost along the way, please don't forget me
Know that I'll be here

Chorus
I'll be there........
I'll find my way to you.........
