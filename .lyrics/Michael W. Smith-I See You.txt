Lord, You're leading me
With a cloud by day
And then in the night
The glow of a burning flame

And everywhere I go I see you
Everywhere I go I see you

And You take my hand
And You wash it clean
I know the promised land
Is light years ahead of me

And everywhere I go I see you
Everywhere I go I see you

And the eagle flies
And the rivers run
I look through the night
I can see the risin' sun

And everywhere I go I see you
Everywhere I go I see you

Well, the grass will die
And the flowers fall
But Your Word's alive
Will be after all

And everywhere I go I see you
Everywhere I go I see you
