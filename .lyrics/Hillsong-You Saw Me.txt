Your glory fills the heavens
Your glory fills the earth
Still You chose surrender
You gave Yourself for me

God of my salvation
Hope of righteousness
You paid the price of freedom
You took a lonely cross

Bless the Lord always
Bless Your holy Name

And You saw me
When You took a crown of thorns
And Your blood washed over me
And You loved me
Through the nails that You bore
And Your blood washes over me

Amazing like no other
Grace without an end
As Your word had promised
You died and rose again
