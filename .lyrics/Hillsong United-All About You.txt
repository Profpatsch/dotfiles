Hear our praises, 
Hear Your people sing
Hear our hearts cry, 
Your love is everything

And all will hear this sound
As the nations turn to You
And this will be our anthem

Cause we're all about You
And the world You promised
And all we have will give you praise
Cause we're all about You
And the world can't stop us
Living Your Way
Always

Let our hearts break,
As we praise your name
Let the earth shake, 
This is the sound of faith

And all will hear this sound
As the nations turn to You
And this will be our anthem

Cause we're all about You
And the world You promised
And all we have will give you praise
Cause we're all about You
And the world can't stop us
Living Your Way
Always

And the walls will fall down
and religion will break
And the nations will hear this shout 
Can you hear the sound of faith?

Cause we're all about You
Cause we're all about You
(4x)

Cause we're all about You
And the world You promised
And all we have will give you praise
Cause we're all about You
And the world can't stop us
Living Your Way
Always

Cause we're all about You
Cause we're all about You 
(4x)

And all the walls are falling down
As all the nations praise
And all the world will hear this shout
Can you hear the sound of faith?
