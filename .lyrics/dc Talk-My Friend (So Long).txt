I heard your record on the telephone
It was my cousin, Joan
She picked it up from the top 40 rack and then

I read your interview in Rolling Stone
You threw the boys a bone
And so I genuinely felt obliged to call

I know You never meant to hurt us, man
We're just a baby band
You found a quicker way
To scale the wall of fame

The situation's awfully dim
Should we up and go with him?
No way (no way, 1, 2, 3, 4)

(chorus)
We know exactly where you are, and you're gone (my friend)
Don't know exactly where you're coming from
You've gone away my friend
We know exactly where you are, and you're gone (my friend)
Don't know exactly where you're coming from
Have you gone astray (gone)

I saw your video on VH-1
Looks like they spent a ton
How does it feel to be the flavor for a spell

And I remember when you used to say
"Jesus is the way"
I never thought I'd see your light begin to fade

The situation's awfully dim
Should we up and go with him?
No way (no way, 1, 2, 3, 4)

(repeat chorus)

(bridge)
Don't think we don't miss you
(We think about you every day)
We still love you anyway
('cause Love don't go away)
There's still this burning question
(I got to know) Why?

(What will people think when they
Hear that I'm a Jesus freak?)

Ah, ah, ah (hey)
(While this is something of fantasy)
(The moral of the story is)
(To stick with your friends)
Ah, ah, ah, ah (hey)
(What will you do if you lose 'em)
(You've known 'em all since you were 10)
(Get off your butt)
Ah, ah, ah, (hey)
(Go think of all the things you did)
(You would get shot for one of them)
(and they would for you, too)
Ah, ah, ah (hey, hey, 1, 2, 3, 4)

(repeat chorus) 

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, and you're gone (my friend)
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, so long
You've gone away, my friend
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, and you're gone (my friend)
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, so long
We'll see you someday
Wish you well
Na, na, na, na, na, my friend
