On a plane somewhere again
I take my place in line just like every other time
I slide into my window seat
She was sitting there
One seat over so I said "Hello, how are you today?"
With my smile I could see the hope within her eyes
And I knew that something's different today

Though everything's the same inside
There's something real
A faith which causes me to change
(But what's different now)
A spark is gleaming in my eye
Like diamond stars that fill the sky
I think a smile says it all
A smile says it all

The conversation presses on
As miles pass below, she said I have to let you know
You seem so different to me
There is a joy inside
The love of God is all I know
From which this could originate
With one smile I could see
The faith we share inside
And I know that something's different today

I see what a smile can say about me
I know that words are not always what speak
Sometimes it's not what I say
That the world around me seems to understand
