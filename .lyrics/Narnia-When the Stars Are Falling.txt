Ace to face with the liar
Once again he plays his role
Tempting me, dark desire
Sense the evil of his soul

Lift me up and lead me on
In my weakness You are strong
You are with me when the night is falling
When the world is upside down
When the king has lost his crown
You are with me when the stars are falling

Yeaaah...

Turning the page to another day, another day of grace
Father forgive me for the things that I've done
Walk right beside me, I know that You will

Lift me up and lead me on
In my weakness You are strong
You are with me when the night is falling
When the world is upside down
When the king has lost his crown
You are with me when the stars are falling

I will cry no more
I seek forgiveness and I will be free

Lift me up and lead me on
In my weakness You are strong
You are with me when the night is falling
When the world is upside down
When the king has lost his crown
You are with me when the stars are falling

Lift me up and lead me on
In my weakness You are strong
You are with me when the night is falling
When the world is upside down
When the king has lost his crown
You are with me when the stars are falling
