I'm in love with a girl,
Everybody seems to know.
I'll sing it loud,
Sing it 'cos I'm feeling proud of love.
Oh yeah, this is love.

You take me away to another place,
You show me a way to a higher grace.
You take me away to another place,
I'm seeing it all with a happy face.

She can walk on the waves,
Crashing through my own desire.
Swing and sway,
Dance until my demons fly away.
This is love, this is love.
