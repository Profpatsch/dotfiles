Verse 1:
Great is the Lord
God almighty
great is the Lord on high
The train of His robe
fills the temple
and we cry out
highest praise

Pre-Chorus:
Glory to the risen king
glory to the Son
glorious Son

Chorus:
Lift up your heads
open the doors
let the king
of glory come in
and forever be our God

Verse 2:
Holy is the Lord
God almighty
holy is the Lord on high
let all the earth
bow before you
and crown You Lord of all
