He's driving down a road to nowhere 
The moon reflects off his spotless car 
Speeding away from all he's known 
To greener grass on the other side 

He's a million dollar man 
He's got everything he wanted 
But now what he wants is what he had 
But he threw it all away 
For a life filled with cars and rings 
And everything that money can bring 

Now everything is not what he thought 
As guilt reaches in for all of his wrong 
The profit is worthless when you're alone 
The grass isn't greener on this lonely side 
He threw it all away
