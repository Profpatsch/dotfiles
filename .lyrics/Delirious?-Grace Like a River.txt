Mystery of mysteries
that you could love someone like me
in your hands eternity
and yet you have the time for me
a love so undeserved
you held nothing in reserve
Heaven played its symphony
I took your hand and you rescued me

Grace like a river
is flowing down
is flowing down
Grace like a river
it's flowing down to me

Staring at my history
was all alone but never free
the sands of time have let me see
your faithful shadow next to me
a love so unreserved
I did nothing to deserve
Love so free but what's the cost
to carry this old rugged cross


Grace like a river
is flowing down (how sweet the sound)
Grace like a river
is flowing down (oh you're all around)
singing Grace is like a river
it is flowing down to me

I love you
I thank you
I'm nothing 
Without you

(Grace like a river)
Is flowing down, is flowing down

(Oh your Grace like a river)
is flowing down on me

and I'm signing here cos you're all I want
you're the sweetest sound the healing sound
flowing down, ooooooh
