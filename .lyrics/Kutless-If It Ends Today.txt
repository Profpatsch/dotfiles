Seems like the end is coming
Seems like the signs are lining up
As far as I can see

We're closer now than ever
This pain won't last forever
Love, love is on his way

So stand up
The time is now to lift up your head

Raise your hands
If you're with me
Raise your hands
If you're ready
Say hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
I'm not afraid
Hey! Hey! Hey!
If it ends today

There's hope on our horizon
Let it be the sound that's rising up
It's rising up

We could be the generation
To shout out to every nation
Love, love is on his way

So stand up
The time is now to lift up your head

Raise your hands
If you're with me
Raise your hands
If you're ready
Say hey! Hey! I'm not afraid
Hey! Hey! Hey!
If it ends

Raise your hands
If you're with me
Raise your hands
If you're ready
Say hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
I'm not afraid

Get ready, get ready, get ready,
Are ou ready? (I'm ready!)
Get ready (I'm ready!)
Get ready (I'm ready!)
Get ready (I'm ready!)

Raise your hands if you're with me
Raise your hands come on and say
Hey! Hey!
I'm not afraid
Hey, hey, hey
If it ends

Raise your hands if you're with me
Raise your hands come on and say
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
I'm not afraid
Hey, hey, hey
If it ends today
