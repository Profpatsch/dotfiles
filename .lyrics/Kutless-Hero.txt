Who ever told you you can't win
 Who ever said that if you fail don't try again
 It s in the ordinary
 Deep in the weak and weary
 The power to overcome the fear you're holding in

 You could be Hero
 You could be the change in this world
 Rise above the Normal
 Don t have to be afraid any more

 We are the light we are the hope
 We are the love inside worth ﬁghting for
 You could be, you could be, you could be a hero

 You don't have to look that hard to see
 You don't have to reach that far to ﬁnd someone in need
 There is a desperation deep in this generation
 Looking for something new a love they can believe

 You could be Hero
 You could be the change in this world
 Rise above the Normal
 Don't have to be afraid any more
 We are the light we are the hope
 We are the love inside worth ﬁghting for
 You could be, you could be, you could be a hero

 Love will even cross the ocean wide
 Love will lose it all to save a life
 Because of the love God gave you'll ﬁnd

 That you could be hero
 That you could be hero
 That you could be hero

 You could be Hero
 You could be the change in this world
 Rise above the Normal
 Don't have to be afraid any more
 We are the light we are the hope
 We are the love inside worth ﬁghting for
 You could be, you could be, you could be a hero
