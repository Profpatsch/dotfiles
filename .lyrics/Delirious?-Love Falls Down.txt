Yes, I'm living for today, when our dreams won't go away
And the promise that you gave
To see the earth resound with praise

And I believe it's time to change
And yes, I need your hand to break these chains

And love falls down on me
Love falls down on me

Yes, we're going all the way, tomorrow's dreams are here today
I feel the joy beneath my feet
Will it be long before we meet?

And I believe my heart has found
All the good that comes from God above

And love falls down on me
Love falls down on me
And when heaven opens love will come
And will roll like a river, yeah love falls down
