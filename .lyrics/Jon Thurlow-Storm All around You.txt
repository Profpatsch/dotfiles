I know there are creatures all around You
I know there are lightenings and thunderings
I know there's a storm all around You
Holy, Holy, Holy

I see seven lamps of fire burning
I see a sea of glass mingled with fire burning
I see the Son of Man with eyes of fire burning
Burning, burning, burning

Halle- Halle- Hallelujah
For the Lord God omnipotent reigns

Everyone in the temple cries holy (glory)

Give us the fear of the Lord that we would not depart from You

The Lord is in His temple
Let all flesh tremble
