She fooled all of her friends
Into thinking she's so strong
But she still sleeps with the light on
And she acts like it's all right on
As she smiles again
And her mother lies there sick with cancer
And her friends don't understand her
She's a question without answers
Who feels like falling apart 

She knows, she's so much more than worthless
But she needs to find her purpose
She wonders what she did to deserve this and

She's calling out to You, 
This is a call, this is a call out
'Cause everytime I fall down
I reach out to you
And I'm losing all control now
And my hazard signs are all out
I'm asking you to show me what this life is all about

And he tells everyone a story
Because he thinks his life is boring
And he fights, so you won't ignore him
Because that's his biggest fear
And he cries, but you'll rarely see him do it
And he loves, but he's scared to use it
So he hides behind the music
'Cause he likes it that way 

And he knows, he's so much more than worthless
He needs to find the surface
'Cause he's starting to get nervous and

He's calling out to You
This is a call, this is a call out
Everytime I fall down
I reach out to you
And I'm losing all control now
And my hazard signs are all out
I'm asking you to show me what this life is all about

Have you ever felt this way before? 
'Cause I don't want to hide here anymore
Take me to a place where nothing's wrong, and
Thanks for coming, shut the door
And they say someone out there sees us
Well if you're real, then save me Jesus
'Cause I've been this way, for far too long
I wasn't meant to feel alone 

Now I'm calling out to You, 
This is a call, this is a call out
'Cause everytime I fall down
I reach out to you
And I'm losing all control now
And my hazard signs are all out
I'm asking you to show me what this life is all about
Show me what this life is all about
