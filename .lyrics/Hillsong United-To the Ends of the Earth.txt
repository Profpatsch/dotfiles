Love unfailing
Overtaking my heart
You take me in
Finding peace again
Fear is lost in 
All you are

And I would give the world to tell Your story
Cause I know that You've called me
I know that You've called me
I've lost myself for good within Your promise
I won't hide it
I won't hide it

Jesus, I believe in You
And I would go to the ends of the earth
To the ends of the earth 
For You alone are the Son of God
And all the world will see
That You are God
You are God.
