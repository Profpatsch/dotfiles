Dear God I'd love to write your songs.
But it's so hard for me to find the right words.
I'll take my time to pray and ask
for You to come so I can carry on.

So here I am dear God,
Right now, I'm longing for you, I'm willing to give my heart.

Cause you are holy
You are holy
You are worthy all my praise
