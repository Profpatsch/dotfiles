I need You here
I need You here
You're like the rain that falls
Fall on this heart and make me new

I look to You
I look to You
Your're king above the earth
And you have put heaven in my heart

I only want to be where You are

Chorus:
Holy, holy is the Lord
King of glory
Forever
Saviour of the world

I look to You
I look to You
Your're King above the earth
And You have put heaven in my heart

I only want to be where You are

Chorus:
Holy, holy is the Lord
King of glory
Forever
Saviour of the world

Holy, holy is the Lord
King of glory
Forever
Saviour of the world

Though mountains maybe moved
And fall into the raging seas
You'll never let me fall
You hold me in Your nail scarred hands.

I only want to be where You are
I only want to be where You are
I only want to be where You are

Holy, holy is the Lord
King of glory
Forever
Saviour of the world

Holy, holy is the Lord
King of glory
Forever
Saviour of the world
