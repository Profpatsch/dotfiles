Lord, You take my heart away with Your love
And I, am willing to put on my faith in Your plan

Come and take my life 
Make my soul refreshed in truth now

I am ready for You
Take my heart and make me new now
I am ready for You
To come and fill my soul

Cleanse, all of my mind that is not of You
Break me, teaching me how to find rest in Your hands

Whatever it takes
I'm needing to make Your will be done
and I'm letting go of my control
For I see what You've done in me
