She told him she'd rather fix her makeup 
than try to fix what's going on 
But the problem keeps on calling 
even with the cell phone gone 
She told him that she believes in living 
bigger than she's living now 
But her world keeps spinning backwards 
and upside down 

Don't say so long, you're not that far gone.
Don't spend today away, 'cause today will soon be 

Gone, like yesterday is gone, 
Like history is gone 
Just try to prove me wrong and pretend like you're immortal 

She said, he said, live like no tomorrow 
Every day we borrow brings us 
one step closer to the edge (infinity) 
Where's your treasure, where's your hope, 
if you get the world and lose your soul? 
She pretends like she pretends like she's immortal 

Don't say so long, you're not that far gone
This could be your big chance to make-up 
Today will soon be 

Gone, like yesterday is gone 
Like history is gone 
The world keeps spinning on 
You're going, going, 
Gone, like summer break is gone, 
Like Saturday is gone 
Just try to prove me wrong and 
pretend like you're immortal. 

We are not infinite 
We are not permanent 
Nothing is immediate 
And we pretend like we're immortal. 
We are so confident in our accomplishments 
Look at our decadence 

Gone, like Frank Sinatra, like Elvis and his mom, 
Like Al Pacino's cash, nothing lasts in this life 
Gone, my high school dreams are gone, 
my childhood sweets are gone 
Life is a day that doesn't last for long. 

Life is more than money, time was never money 
Time was never cash, life is still more than girls. 
Life is more than hundred dollar bills and roto-tom fills, 
Life is more than fame and rock and roll and thrills, 
All the riches of the kings end up in wills 
We've got information in the information age 
but do we know what life is outside of our convenient Lexus cages? 

She said he said live like no tomorrow 
Every moment that we borrow brings us closer 
to a God who's never been short of cash 
Hey Bono, I'm glad you asked. 
Life is still worth living, life is more that we are.
