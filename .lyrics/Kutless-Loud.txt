I put it all on the line when I talk to you
Cuz if I keep it underground, it can't get through
I want for you to see the very best in me
My eyes are open wide and now I'm breathing
I've finally broken free the fire burns in me

You can try and turn me down
But I was born to be this loud
How can I be quiet now
When I believe it and I want it

I'm not gonna wait till I'm out of time
Please forgive me if it seems like I'm out of line
I hope that you believe, I'm not your enemy
I'm not the least bit concerned with my own way
But I cannot ignore the things I'm living for

You can try and turn me down
But I was born to be this loud
How can I be quiet now
When I believe it and I want it
