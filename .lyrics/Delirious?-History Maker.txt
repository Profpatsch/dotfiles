Is it true today that when people pray
Cloudless skies will break, kings and queens will shake?
Yes, it's true and I believe it
I'm living for you

Is it true today that when people pray
We'll see dead men rise, and the blind set free
Yes, it's true and I believe it
I'm living for you

CHORUS
I'm gonna be a history maker in this land
I'm gonna be a speaker of truth to all mankind
I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna run
Into your arms, into your arms again

Well, it's true today that when people stand
With the fire of God, and the truth in hand
We'll see miracles, we'll see angels sing
We'll see broken hearts making history
Yes, it's true and I believe it
We're living for you

CHORUS
CHORUS

Into your arms, into your arms again
Into your arms (into your arms again)
Into your arms

You can do it, yeah

Hey, do you?
Whoo-hoo
Whoo-hoo

CHORUS

(Into your arms)

History makers
Whoo-hoo
