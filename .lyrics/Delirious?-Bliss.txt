I feel lonely when it's you I miss
I feel crazy when I dream like this
I've travelled all this way for just one kiss
Is it bliss?  Is it bliss? Yes it is
Rock 'n roll is everything
Everything to a lonely man
And never will I bow to you

I, I'm not backing down
I, I'm not backing down

Take me to the place where eagles fly
Where my love for you I can never deny
If I'm right then you are wrong
If I'm wrong then I really lived
And if I die with no reward
Then I know I had peace 'cause I carried the sword

I, I'm not backing down
I, I'm not backing down

It's the simple things that satisfy
Keeps my feet on the ground and my head in the sky
I love you more than I can say 
And I won't change my mind on the choices I made
