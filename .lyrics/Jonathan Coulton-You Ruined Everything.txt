I was fine, I pulled myself together
Just in time to throw myself away
Once my perfect world was gone I knew 
You ruined everything in the nicest way
You should know how great things were before you
Even so, they're better still today
I can't think of who I was before
You ruined everything in the nicest way
Bumps in the road remind us
The worst of the best behind us
Only good things will find us, me and you
Days will be clear and sunny
We're gonna need more money
Baby you know it's funny
All those stories coming true
Despite my better efforts it's all for you
The worst kind of cliche
I'll be with you til the day you leave
You ruined everything in the nicest way
