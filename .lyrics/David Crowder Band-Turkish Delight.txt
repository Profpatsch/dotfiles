Stumbled through the doorway
Into the strangest thing 
An unexpected magic land
With snow beneathe my feet
Came across a lady who
Dressed herself in white 
She took her coat to cover me
Then a query cold as ice

What do you want?

Turkish Delight
(It's my favorite thing) It's my favorite thing
Turkish Delight
(All I want to do) What I wouldn't do, what I wouldn't do
Turkish Delight
(It's my favorite thing) It gets me every time
Turkish Delight
(All I want to do) What I wouldn't give, what I wouldn't give 
(What I wouldn't do for her?)

Wouldn't think I'd fall for it
Wouldn't think I'd lie
But I think I'd do anything
For that tiny bit of pie
I would sell you out 
I'd give you all away
A life of treats might do me in
But I gotta get another taste

Turkish Delight
(It's my favorite thing) It's my favorite thing
Turkish Delight
(All I want to do) What I wouldn't do, what I wouldn't do
Turkish Delight
(It's my favorite thing) It gets me every time
Turkish Delight
(All I want to do) What I wouldn't give, what I wouldn't give 
(What I wouldn't do for her?)

The more I have the more I want...
