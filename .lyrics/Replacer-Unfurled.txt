You'd better mind yourself 
And find yourself a mind 
To share your secrets with 
All the world 

You'd better find yourself 
And mind your manners when 
She wakes you from your dream 
Wings unfurled 

Hello, my name is Happy :) 

You better show yourself 
Cause you know what you know 
She promised to unravel the world 

But you can change it all 
And when the music plays 
You can bring back those days 
Wings unfurled
