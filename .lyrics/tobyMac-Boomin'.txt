I've been around the way
I've been around the block
I got the keys to the city if the gates are locked
And a freak like me ain't 'bout to stop
I got a hand full of dreams and a heart full of God
Everywhere we go they wonder where we're from
Well it's diverse city y'all welcome to come
It sits high on a hill you can see it for days
And even if you can't you can hear our praise
We go...
Cause we're boomin' out the stereo system
This goes out to anyone listening
Boomin' out the stereosystem
Here to rep the most high with this one
Boomin' out the stereo system

This goes out to anyone listening
Boomin' out the stereo system
'Cause we rock for sure in stereo
If you're looking to slide, come slide with us
And if you're looking for a ride, it's a big old bus
We got black fold, white folk and Middle East
Mexican, Filipino- Jesus Freaks
Got a Haitian Princess, an Aussie Mate
East Coast, Midwest to left side of the states
And when the bus rolls, it's out the dirty south
Tennessee and we keepin' it good and loud we go
I got portable sounds to lift me up 
Portable sounds to take me higher
Portable sounds to lift me up
So don't even try to get in my head
