I will give thanks to the Lord
With all my heart
I wil tell of all Thy wonders
I will be glad and exult in Thee

I will trust in You my God
Who delivered me
And lifted me from the gates of death
I will be glad and exult in Thee

I will give thanks to the Lord
With all my heart
I will tell of all Thy wonders
I will be glad and exult in Thee

I will tell of all Thy wonders
I will be glad and exult in Thee
