I need Your Love 
Like the desert needs the rain
I need Your touch 
Like the fire needs the flame 
One moment without You near 
Is heartache I cannot bear 
A lifetime with You O Lord  
Is Heaven I long to Know 
Heaven

Come over me 
Like the oceans meets the shore
Shine on my life
Like the morning 
Steals the light
