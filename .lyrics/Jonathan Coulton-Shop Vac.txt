We took the freeway out of town
We found a place to settle down
We bought a driveway and a swingset and a dog

You got your very own bathroom
I got my very own workshop in the basement
We'll sit around staring at the wall-to-wall
Take fieldtrips to our favorite mall
Waiting for the day when all
The kids grow up and leave us here

If you need me
I'll be downstairs
With the Shop Vac
You can call but I probably won't hear you
Because it's loud with the Shop Vac on

But you'll be okay
'Cause you'll be upstairs
with the TV
You can cry and I probably won't hear you
Because it's loud with the Shop Vac on

We hung a flag above the door
Checked out the gourmet grocery store
I bought a mower I can ride around the yard
But we haven't got real friends
And now even the fake ones have stopped calling

Maybe if you forget to hide the keys
I'll take a ride to Applebee's
I'll come home drunk on daiquiris
And throw up on the neighbor's lawn

If you need me
I'll be downstairs
With the Shop Vac 
You can call but I probably won't hear you
Because it's loud with the Shop Vac on

But you'll be okay
'Cause you'll be upstairs
With the TV
You can cry and I probably won't hear you
Because it's loud with the Shop Vac on

I like the Starbucks here
That's better than the other one
Because the other one's not as good
They really need to put a light there because it's hard to turn
It's hard to make a left turn

And when it's time to go to bed
I'm still awake inside my head
Floating up above the house and looking down
I guess I gotta go back there
I guess there never was any other answer

And as the freeway hums the cars go by
The headlights roll across the sky
Many miles away and I
Can see them speeding through the dark

If you need me
I'll be downstairs
With the Shop Vac 
You can call but I probably won't hear you
Because it's loud with the Shop Vac on

But you'll be okay
'Cause you'll be upstairs
With the TV
You can cry and I probably won't hear you
Because it's loud with the Shop Vac on
