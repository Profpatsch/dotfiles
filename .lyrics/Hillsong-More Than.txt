Your eternal Word
Formed the universe
And You speak to me
Whisper I'm Your greatest love

You're the saving Lord
Beauty in a storm
Everything I need
More than I could ever want

You are my heart's desire
I have fallen to the point of no return
More than my heart could know
More than in love with You.
