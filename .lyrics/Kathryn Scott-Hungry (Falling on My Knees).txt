Hungry, I come to You
For I know You satisfy 
I am empty but I know Your love does not run dry

So I wait for You
So I wait for You

I've fallen on my knees
Offering all my needs
Jesus, You're all this heart is living for

Broken I run to You
For Your arms are open wide
I am weary, but I know Your touch restores my life

So I wait for You
So I wait for You

I've fallen on my knees
Offering all my needs
Jesus, You're all this heart is living for

I've fallen on my knees
Offering all my needs
Jesus, You're all this heart is living for

So I wait for You
So I wait for You, Yeah

So I wait for You
So I wait for You

And I've fallen on my knees
Offering my needs
Jesus, You're all this heart is living for

Yes, You are
Yes, You are

I've fallen on my knees
Offering all my needs
Jesus, You're all this heart is living for

Hungry, I come to You
For I know You satisfy 
I am empty but I know Your love does not run dry
