(gasps) Oh my, what a terrible dream I had. Or, maybe I'm still having it.

Rarity, Pinkie Pie is about to lose the apple farm. We need Applejack's help!
{Rarity} 
Lose the apple farm? Well we can't let that happen, now can we?

We need to get there by her side.
We can try to do what we can now.
Or together we can be her guide.

The townspeople are furious, we need the old Pinkie Pie back.
{Applejack} 
I'm on it, I know just the thing.

[Applejack]
The townspeople need you, they've been sad for a while.
They march around, faces frown and never seem to smile.
And if you feel like helping, we'd appreciate a lot!
If you get up there and spread some cheer from here to Canterlot!

{Pinkie Pie}
Come on ponies, I wanna see you smile!
{Crowd} 
Pinkie!
