I looked and behold
In the midst of the throne
Stood a Lamb who was slain
Who was holding a scroll
To Him be all glory and dominion

Blessed be the name of the Lord
From this time forth and forevermore
For the name of the Lord is to be praised
From the rising of the morning light
Until the sun sets in the evening sky
Glory to the Righteous One

Be exalted in Your judgement
Stretch out Your scepter of righteousness
You reign on high, Lord, over the nations
And Your glory is in the heavens

Let the earth rejoice

Let all creation lift its voice
For He’s coming to judge the world in righteousness (2×)

All that You do is beautiful
The work of your hands is beautiful
