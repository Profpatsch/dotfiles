I love this world more than I should
It all falls short of what you're worth
How could I think I own my life
When really you're the on who paid the price
I wanna give you every breath,
Every treasure that I hold
Oh, Lord, I give you everything

It's all yours anyway
You gave me life to give it away
It's all yours anyway
It's all yours

I've done my best and it's not enough
But I don't have to earn your love
Still I wanna give you every breath,
Every treasure that I hold
Oh Lord, I give You everything

It's all yours anyway
You gave me life to give it away
It's all yours anyway

With friendship on my broken heart
So here I am
Take everything
It's all yours anyway

You turned my heart around,
I came running back to you
Oh what joy I found surrounded by the truth
That you love me and now I can see

It's all yours anyway
You gave your life to save me
So take my life

It's all yours anyway
You gave me life to give it away
It's all yours anyway

With friendship on my broken heart
So here I am
Take everything
It's all yours anyway
It's all yours
It's yours
It's all yours
It's all yours
