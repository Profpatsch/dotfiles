It's a beautiful day and the world is bright
'Cos you took me away from the longest night
What can I do but give all I have to you

It's a beautiful day and the page has turned
Deep in my soul now your fire burns
What can I do, I'll give it all up for you

You give me everything
Give me hope within
You're the song I sing
You give me everything
Give me hope to win
You're the song I sing

It's a beautiful day and we're running proud
And we'll run to the line
Hear the witness cloud
I know it's true
We're gonna fly
We're gonna dance
On that glorious day with you

You are the light that shines - hey hey
