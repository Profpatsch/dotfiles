Said it's sad, said it was a shame
Bet you thought I caught a boat to Bombay
On the line just to let you know
I will be around

Underneath the bridge to nowhere
Like I'm living out a game of solitaire
Going up to a better day
I will be around

Hey world, it's me
I still have the heart, still have the dream

Come on, people
We've got to come together
It's you and me
Hope will make us stronger
Freedom it rings
Do you hear it calling?
Reach out and touch
And love will take us higher

Somebody threw a brick in my vision
Tried to sabotage my mission
Either way, I believe
I will be around
I wanna know, people, are you with me?
Open up your heart, and just believe
Take a step, let me hear you say
I will be around

Hey world, it's me
I still have the heart, still have the dream

Come on, people
We've got to come together
It's you and me
Hope will make us stronger
Freedom it rings
Do you hear it calling?
Reach out and touch
And love will take us higher

For He knows the plans He has for you
A plan to prosper and not harm you
To give you a future and a hope

Come on, people
We've got to come together
It's you and me
Hope will make us stronger
Freedom it rings
Do you hear it calling?
Reach out and touch
And love will take us higher
