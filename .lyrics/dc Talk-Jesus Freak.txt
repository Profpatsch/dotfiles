(What will people think
When they hear that I'm a Jesus Freak?
What will people do
When they find that's it's true?) 
(oh oh)
(oh oh oh) 
(oh oh)

Separated, I cut myself clean
From a past that comes back in my darkest of dreams
Been apprehended by a spiritual force
And a grace that replaced all the me I've divorced 

I saw a man with tat on his big fat belly
It wriggled around like marmalade jelly
It took me a while to catch what it said
Cause I had to match the rhythm
Of his belly with my head
'Jesus Saves' is what it raved in a typical tattoo green
He stood on a box in the middle of the city
And claimed he had a dream 

What will people think
When they hear that I'm a Jesus freak
What will people do when they find that it's true
(oh oh oh)
I don't really care if they label me a Jesus freak
There ain't no disguising the truth 
(oh oh oh)
(there ain't no disguising the truth, no I ain't hiding the truth)

Kamikaze, my death is gain
I've been marked by my Maker
A peculiar display (peculiar display)
The high and lofty, they see me as weak
Cause I won't live and die for the power they seek 

There was a man from the desert with naps in his head
The sand that he walked was also his bed
The words that he spoke made the people assume
There wasn't too much left in the upper room
With skins on his back and hair on his face
They thought he was strange by the locusts he ate
The Pharisees tripped when they heard him speak
Until the king took the head of this Jesus freak 

What will people think
When they hear that I'm a Jesus freak
What will people do when they find that it's true
(oh oh oh)
I don't really care if they label me a Jesus freak
There ain't no disguising the truth 
(oh oh oh)

What will people think
When they hear that I'm a Jesus freak
What will people do when they find that it's true
(oh oh oh)
I don't really care if they label me a Jesus freak
There ain't no disguising the truth 
(oh oh oh)
(No I ain't into hiding)

People say I'm strange, does it make me a stranger
My best friend was born in a manger
People say I'm strange, does it make me a stranger
That my best friend was born in a manger 

What will people think
When they hear that I'm a Jesus freak
What will people do when they find that it's true
(oh oh oh)
I don't really care if they label me a Jesus freak
There ain't no disguising the truth 
(oh oh oh)

What will people think
When they hear that I'm a Jesus freak
What will people do when they find that it's true
(oh oh oh)
I don't really care if they label me a Jesus freak
There ain't no disguising the truth 
(oh oh oh)

What will people think
(What will people think)
What will people do
(What will people do)
I don't really care
(What else can I say)
There ain't no disguising the truth
(Jesus is the way)
