They say Jesus is doing nothing 
They say evolution took His place 
There's no God that created the world and 
No Savior for the human race 

They say God is powerless 
He laughs aloud as we cry in pain 
It's just a part of his sick, sick humor 
Forcing us to appreciate 

CHORUS: 
You say that God is dead but you're rippin' me off 
You can't infect my mind with your vanity 
You say that God is dead but you're rippin' me off 
You can't infect my mind with your vanity 
You're rippin' me off They say God doesn't even exist 
We made him up just to numb our pain 
They can't believe in a loving God 
Who doesn't believe in atheists 

CHORUS 

We take too much 

CHORUS
