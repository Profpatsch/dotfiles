I'm right here
And I heard everything you said
Those things
To try to get inside my head
Is full
Now there's no room in here
For you
You can't teach me the lesson
Now I know
I don't need you to tell me
How it's done 'cause I know how it's done

See all the accolades, sitting up on my shelf
I'm the man now, and I'm sticking it to myself
Sticking it to myself
Sticking it to my-

Self-control
That's not the only thing I lack
A plan
Just my own gun against my
Back down now and let this hostage
Go away
I'm trying to figure something
Makes me feel
Like I'd do anything it takes to be
A fucking winner now

See all the accolades, sitting up on my shelf
I'm the man now, and I'm sticking it to myself
Sticking it to myself
Sticking it to myself

You don't look interested in what I just said
If you're not listening then don't nod your head

I thought so
That's what I thought that
Someday soon
This job is gonna kill me
Dead inside
Unless I kill it first instead
and when they come for me I'm gone

There's just the accolades, sitting up on my shelf
I'm the man now, and I'm sticking it to myself
Sticking it to myself
Sticking it to myself
