This world has taken me by storm
And makes me feel like running.
This place is making me transform 
Until I feel like nothing.

It's the strength in you and me
That surrounds everything
The way you look out for me
The way you burn

It's the flame in all of us the same,
It makes us feel it's flame
In all of us the same
It makes us feel it.

We are the youth of yesterday,
We've brought you pain and sorrow.
That's what they say, but they pave the way.
We are the new tomorrow.

It's the strength in you and me
That surrounds everything
The way you look after me
The way you burn

It's the flame in all of us the same,
It makes us feel it's flame
In all of us the same
It makes us feel it.

It's the flame in all of us the same,
It makes us feel it's flame
In all of us the same
It makes us feel it.

Its the flame in all of us
Makes the change in all of us
Takes the blame in all of us
And still keeps it alive

Its the flame in all of us
Makes the change in all of us
Takes the blame in all of us
And still keeps it alive
