May our homes be filled with dancing.
May our streets be filled with joy.
May injustice bow to Jesus, as the people turn to pray.

From the mountain to the valley, hear our praises rise to You.
From the heavens to the nations, hear the singing fill the air.
May our light shine in the darkness, as we walk before the cross.
May Your glory fill the whole earth, as the water over sea.
Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
