God, You have done great things
God, You give grace to the weak
And bless the brokenhearted
With a song of praise to sing
You reached down and lifted us up
You came running, looking for us
And now there's nothing
And no one beyond Your love

You're the overflow
You're the fountain of my heart
So let Your mercy rain
Let Your mercy rain on us

God, You have done great things
You give grace to the weak
And bless the brokenhearted
With a song of praise to sing
You reached down and lifted us up
You came running, looking for us
And now there's nothing
And no one beyond Your love, Your love

You're the overflow
You're the fountain of my heart
So let Your mercy rain
Let Your mercy rain on us

You're the faithful one
When the world's falling apart
So let Your mercy rain
Let Your mercy rain on us

How deep, how wide, how long, how high is Your love...
Is Your love
How deep, how wide, how long, how high is Your love...
Is Your love
Oh, God

You're the overflow
You're the fountain of my heart
So let Your mercy rain
Let Your mercy rain on us

You're the faithful one
When the world's falling apart
So let Your mercy rain
Let Your mercy rain on us

You're the faithful one
When my world's falling apart
So let Your mercy rain
Let Your mercy rain on us

Let it rain...
