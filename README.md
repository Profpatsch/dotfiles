# These are…

… my humble dotfiles and general home-directory-shenanigans.  
Feel free to look around, I try to keep them clean and commented.

[**Arch**][arch] or [**NixOS**][nixos] **users** might find them especially
useful. Lots of tooling/config already went into my [nix config][vuizvui], so
that might be worth a look as well.

They are managed with [GNU stow][stow]. To try out the config files for one 
program, pull the repo, cd into it and type `stow <name of program>`. It will 
inform you if there are existing config files you need to backup. Dotfiles with
sensitive contents are in a different repo, managed with stow as well, meaning
some parts of a working config might be missing here.

I’m a native user of the [neo layout][neowiki], so some shortcuts could reflect 
that. ([Neo homepage][neo] (German))  On another note, why are you still typing 
querty anyway? It’s a big pile of shit, to put it nicely.
